Only the notice of the upcoming release this November of Pynchon's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again. It's not that it isn't brilliant. No one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder. The first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you'll ever read. And it's not like this is the only Pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into. There are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at V or Gravity's Rainbow before catching the wave. But Mason and Dixon is a lot of work, if for no other reason than the effort it takes dealing with the mid-18th century prose style. (Can you imagine the effort it took to produce it?) John Barth's Sotweed Factor is similar, and yet somehow infinitely more accessible (and highly recommended!). Pynchon's gift for rapid exposition is not necessarily suited to the constraint on verbal glibness. Especially in a work this voluminous. And yet the darn thing is consistently challenging, if one has the patience and energy to put into it. It seemed to me that the beginning and ending were the best parts, but this could very well have everything to do to the enthusiasm one brings to a new book, and the emotional satisfaction one gain's when reaching towards the conclusion. One thing for sure, for once Pynchon truly has plotted out and delivers a conclusion worthy of the whole work, as opposed to suddenly rushing out a trap door and leaving the reader in a state of suspension (which of course is also one of the many delights of his first three novels). This time one gets the sense that the author has a good deal of affection for his featured players. This book is a great as you want it to be, if you're willing to work at it. I'm just looking forward to the next one being a little more nimble. (Meanwhile, I've got a couple months to see if I can make more of a dent into The Recognitions."}

{"id": "books-positive-348", "domain": "books", "label": 1, "text": "A Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time. True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible. Yet, this novel is still a joy to read. With a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist. Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno. I won't serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth. Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint. Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time. Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth. Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body. And if you take Verne's theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible. However, I do have a couple minor gripes. Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel. Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line. Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic. During their rapid ascent (the details I won't reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., \"the bends\"). Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss. The nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time. A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne's vision of a subterranean world. Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination"}

Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes, Glazed Meatloaf, and Deep-dish Apple Pie) to \"show-off\" company fare (e.g. Baked Brie en Croute, Grill-roasted Chinese Style Duck, and Dark Chocolate Mousse).

{"id": "books-negative-773", "domain": "books", "label": 0, "text": "This is truly a disappointing book. It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot. Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in \"The Hideaway\" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists. The Leilani character is patently ridiculous. She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable. I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot. Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception. Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults. Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety. I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field. Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue. That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow. The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works. It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree. His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs). This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings. Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.

{"id": "books-positive-903", "domain": "books", "label": 1, "text": "\"GPU Gems 2\" edited by Matt Pharr (Addison-Wesley, 2005, ISBN 0-321-33559-7) is a collection of forty-eight white papers that detail cutting edge techniques based on today's latest graphical processing units (GPU). The full color hardcover text is 784 pages and includes a CD-ROM with working demos and source for some of the articles presented in the book. The text retails for $59.99. The book is divided into six parts: geometric complexity, shading, high-quality rendering, general purpose computation on the GPU, image oriented computing, and numerical algorithms. A part has anywhere from five to twelve chapters. Each chapter is written by a different author but the format and style is consistent. The chapters have an introduction, discussion of the problem or technique, conclusion, and references. The material is presented with color illustrations and occasionally some pseudo-code or code fragments. Generally, the material is extremely current and very approachable to read. As a sequel to its well received predecessor, the text focuses on taking advantage of the computational power and features of today's high-powered GPU boards. The first part of the book, geometric complexity, emphasizes this with chapters dedicated to batch rendering, using multi-streaming, hardware occlusion, and displacement pixel-shaders. Each chapter illustrates how operations traditionally performed on the CPU can be moved into the GPU for efficiency and greater effect. The subsequent two parts on shading and rendering continue along the same theme: improved performance by using hardware functionality found on the GPU. Each topic considers the performance ramifications and GPU capabilities when discussing the problem domain of a rendering technique and factors it into the final solution. For example, chapter 10 considers irradiance environment maps for fast lighting - but with a twist - using the GPU to do the calculations in real-time. In doing so, the book's real value becomes apparent. The fourth part on general purpose GPU computation is an interesting addition to the text. The chapters illustrate methods of offloading traditional CPU tasks by exploiting the inherent parallel nature of modern GPU hardware. Since the book features Nvidia hardware, the architecture and performance capabilities largely focused on their products. In the fifth part of the book, hardware assisted image creation and analysis is considered. By using context clues from the spatial, texture, or lighting data - additional refinements can be made to a scene prior to rasterization. The topics presented in this part are further refinements of the text's main theme (using the GPU fully) and are specific solutions to uncommon problems - or approaches to rasterization. None the less as GPUs continue to evolve, the topics presented in this section will undoubtedly become more common. Finally, the sixth part of the book provides several non-traditional graphics examples to illustrate calculating data on the GPU: solving linear equations, options pricing, and numerical simulation - just to name a few. As using the raw floating point power of modern GPU is a growing trend - these sections were quite interesting and well done. The included CD-ROM contains examples to 28 of the 48 articles in the book. In most cases, the example material includes source code as well as pre-compiled binaries to help illustrate the topic presented in the text. In order to run the majority of the samples, Cg must be installed on the host computer. In addition, the CD-ROM provides access to Nvidia's software development kit, Cg toolkit, performance tools, and several helpful reference links to on-line sites. GPU Gems 2 provides a cutting edge view of the capabilities found in today's video cards. The selected articles illustrate that every part of the rendering process can be enhanced in some fashion by fully using the underlying hardware. As such, this book is essential to anyone working with modern GPUs."}

{"id": "books-negative-956", "domain": "books", "label": 0, "text": "It would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrell's reasoning, but to make a few points: 1. He implies that female 'circumcision' is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance. If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems?? It's for protection? What, or whose, interests are being protected? 2. He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males. Castration is known to increase the male life-span. Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less? Surely illogical? 3. The male 'instinct' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction. As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect'. And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control. This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females. Why do women need protection form their protectors? Men need to explain their logic here. Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs? 4. Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again, the sacred testosterone drives this not women. 5. His views on rape are ridiculous. Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not. These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion. Men are responding to fake signals that females don't know how to override without becoming invisible altogether. 6. This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of females.The men who fail are the men without power. Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as likely as men feeling sorry for, and diverting their monogamous sexual interest and resources towards, unnattractive old women. 7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being abusive about women who don't sexually reject most men (ie the easy women) at the same time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women. There must be some mysterious male logic to it - perhaps situated in a fantasy world of being the only male who isn't rejected. Duplicity is clearly a male trait that farrell failed to mention. 8. It is a suspect logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and political leaders for millennia ie males, have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females. For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is impossible. To argue that they have is Farrell's most ludicrous argument. Of course women also have self-interest, intimately tied to that of their children. The very real difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to male-bonded kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size, kin-bonding, no real reproductive demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding. They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as female power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly illogical and contrary to reality. It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island free sex and mermaids. This book is interesting for debate and as an example of male sexual frustration being blamed on women. Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get sexual/reproductive access to females and might help us notice that the 'power' being defined is reproduction. In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the tiny market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create massive competition in males and competition in females for better quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring. Embedded in Farrell's books is the manipulative attempt to solve this by encouraging young women to 'put out' more. It's the same old male longing for 'free' sex ie the usual reproductive behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females. In nature male animals experience far less or equal disposability as females when they are monogamous and concentrate more on parenting ie are symmetrical with female reproductive behavior. Can we look forward to this in the human male in the near future and solve the whole problem? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their sex-drive/seeking multiple partners and increasing their childcare. Reduce testosterone? Or is that blasphemy? The new question is What do men want? The answer is the same as ever - sex. The methods of trying to get it are the same even when put in a new wrapper such as Farrell's ie irrationality, deceit and manipulation. Perhaps the real myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes, hormones, fetuses, infants and children that are the real reason males and females exist, are pulled together and driven apart. At least let's not create a new myth that the human male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest. How gullible does Farrell hope we are"}

Not every word of When Character Was King is the utterly necessary word at the absolutely necessary time -- a few of her words don't fit and an occasional fact is flubbed -- but all other words of hundreds and thousands fit perfectly into the best portrait we have of a good and great man, a description also used fittingly for Dwight Eisenhower. Noonan, I believe, is the only biographer of President Reagan who understands the import of a first-term footnote, an episode that most of the world has learned to forget or, like Reeves, has learned to diminish. That's the PATCO strike which, as Noonan shows, had world-historical implications.

As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span. Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come from C++, Java or C#, you may be struck by its simplicity, compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages.

Given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure. But the Roeblings' gaps in knowledge also worked against them. One of the most interesting portions of the book is where McCullough discusses the pressurized caissons beneath the East River where Washington Roebling and many his workers spent their time. Few doctors or engineers at the time knew how high pressure environments would affect the human body. The quick changes in pressure killed workers and left many, including Washington, with a condition known as the bends. Washington's wife, Emily, was forced to transform herself into chief engineer while Washington struggled with the bends. There are lots of fascinating facts and tidbits throughout this book on the bridge and the people involved with its construction.

The author is brilliant, not to mention right on the things he says. It's just that the writer's style is so abstract and nebulous that he's absolutely maddening to try and follow. One moment, he'll be talking about how religion evolved, and the next he jumps to an illustration that takes half a page and uses language that is so illusive you ask, \"What in the world is he saying now?\" I got so excited in the first chapter while things made sense, and then noticed how he drifted here and there, making good points and then totally abandoning them. I bought this book three years ago and just recently finished reading it because I had to keep going out of my way to put it down and come back to it!! It never seemed to get better. I gleaned a few good points and enjoyed it...well...sort of, but the author is so unclear at times that it drives you nuts - and this is coming from an atheist who agrees with the philosophical position of the author!

{"id": "books-negative-974", "domain": "books", "label": 0, "text": "First a little background... I'm 53 with a preteen son. I'm not quite a Luddite. I make my living from an online business that I own and operate. Our \"big\" present to our son last Xmas was a computer -- one he and I were going to build from scratch. The main use of the computer was going to be video games and school work. We gave our son a budget (not big by gamer PC standards) to shop for the parts. I've read a few books recently on the gaming \"culture\" to better understand it. This book came highly recommended from reviews here, so I read it. My reaction to the book? It took a while, but I finally realized it felt like I was reading a study paid for and prepared on behalf of the video game industry. There are lots of great statistics, but rather flimsy rational defending extensive video game playing and how it's successfully preparing gamers to succeed in the future. I did learn a few things. I got a dose of reality about why it seems like everyone under 35 plays video games extensively. I see that the *gamer generation* has a lot to offer. I also seriously wonder about the gaps in what they have to offer. A main thesis of the book is that gamers learn how to think and figure things out, because video games are about figuring out how to beat the game. Interesting, since by the examples cited, it mostly appears to be trial and error with no significant logic involved. I call it learn by trying anything, as opposed to learn by thinking. Both have their place. Supposedly, gamers are more willing to take (theoretically controlled) risks as well. Somehow the authors see the dot.com boom (and bust) as an endorsement of the future of business in the hands of gamers (who largely ran the dot.coms). I see a different story than the authors from those days of yore. I could go on, but I think you get the point. The book says little (nothing?) about how video games are helping gamers learn math, science, or reading. Personally, I believe those skills/knowledge are MUCH more important to a person's future than the ability to learn thru trial and error. Maybe the conclusions of the authors will prove to be correct. I hope so. But personally, I'm concerned for any business that runs on the pure gamer mentality that I understand to be endorsed by the book."}

It has a lot of good stories that are very entertaining and each of them illuminates important spiritual truths. The focus of this book is on misconceptions about enlightenment and samdhi experiences. Also, it contains some beautiful accounts of samdhi experiences taken from various religious traditions. There is a lot of practical wisdom in this book about finding meaning on the spiritual path and in life in general. Jack Kornfield dispels the illusion we are ever a finished product or that our various personality quirks will ever disappear completely. In one section, he quotes Ram Dass who once was asked, did you get rid of all your personality problems and he replied, \"no.. but I've become a connoisseur of my neurosis.\" In another section, Jack talks about vocation or purpose in life. I found this to be particularly well done and personally meaningful. While the book is good, I think you may get more out of the audio CD because you get to hear the tone of his voice and inflections. I think this carries a part of the communication that doesn't come across in his books. My favorite taped work by Jack Kornfield is your Buddha Nature.

So imagine my surprise when, after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas, I read the erroneous account of the Children's Crusade of 1212. I had done research on this topic, so I was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred. Had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years? If he had, he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly French people led by Stephen of Cloyes who, when told to turn back by King Philip II, did so. That ended that crusade. The other one, led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas, led a group across the Alps into Italy. Some left for home while others continued on to Rome. It's interesting to note that in Rome, many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these \"children\" were either too old or because they were pregnant. Perhaps until relatively recently, people believed in the Children's Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles (like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred, rather than relying on more contemporary sources. Nor did they realize that the latin word \"pueri\" used in the chronicles can have several meanings (such as unmarried men rather than children). In the final analysis, you just can't rely on books like these to really teach you history. The best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it. If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel's own account of the Children's Crusade on their website, or perhaps read the excellent paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History, or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia. The book gave two pages to this event, and sadly got it completely wrong. For this gross oversight, I am compelled to give it one star. Readers of history, never just believe what you read - verify"}

{"id": "books-negative-410", "domain": "books", "label": 0, "text": "I must say that after reading this book, I am more confused than ever as to the origins of the war between Japan and the US. The book starts in 1936, although most knowledgable people know that the march to war really began with the Japanese seizure of Manchuria in 1932. The author continually repeats the refrain that \"Americans don't understand the Japanese mentality and culture\", and it was this \"misunderstanding\" that led to the war. It is true that Toland defines the Japanese term \"gekokujo\" as being some sort of \"insubordination\" that led to the Kwantung Army to feel it could move, presumably without orders from Tokyo, into Manchuria. However, Toland does not explain how this could happen. There is little description of the power structure in Japan, we do know that there was some attempt to create parliamentary democracy, but there were also the giant oligarchs who had much power, plus the military hierarchy. Somehow, the military took control in the 1930's, but Toland doesn't really say how. He describes in detail the \"2/26\" Uprising of young officers in 1936, and how they were willing to kill without compunction, and how fanatical they were, yet we are then told that they OPPOSED expansion into China, and that the repression of this coup attempt would lead to an expanded war in China. I must say I don't understand this at all...Toland potrays them as militaristic fanatics, yet they seem to be \"the good guys\". Weren't those who supported expansion into China also militaristic fanatics? This is left totally unexplained. Toland then goes on to describe the fatal \"Incident at the Marco Polo Bridge\" in 1937 near Peking (Beijing) which led to the full-scale invasion of China. Toland says the government in Tokyo, again, had nothing to do with it, in fact both the Chinese and Japanese commanders on the spot tried to calm things down, but some undefined \"hotheads\" (possibly Chinese Communists) kept inflaming the situation. Somehow (without Toland telling us how), a decision is made by someone (not necessarily the \"peace-loving\" Japanese Prime Minister Prince Konoye) to mount a full-scale invasion of China. An impression is left by Toland that the Chinese, particulary, the Koumintang government of Chiang Kai-shek was provocative and unreasonable. All I know is that that Marco Polo Bridge is within China, and it is understandable that the Chinese would resent the Japanese military presence there. After this, we move on to the atrocities of the \"Rape of Nanking\", which again, according to Toland, \"somehow\" happens, (Toland does admit that there were atrocities and between 200,000 and 300,000 Chinese were butchered by their \"brother Asians\" who claimed to be liberating them(?)). Toland says the Japanese commander at Nanking did not order any such behavior, nor again, did the government in Tokyo. How then do thousands of supposedly disciplined Japanese troops suddenly get it into their heads to do such things? Toland doesn't give us a clue, other than his general statement that \"westerners don't understand the Japanese\". Toland also, in a way, tries to claim that Western opposition to Japanese expansion into China was \"hypocritical\" because of Western Colonialism in East Asia (US in the Philippines; Britain in Hong Kong, Malaya, Burma, India; Dutch in East Indies; French in Indochina), however, by the 1930's the US had already agreed to give the Philippines independence and the British were beginning to wind down the Raj in India was setting up an autonomous Indian government, so it was apparent that Colonialism was already on its way out before the war. All this makes me wonder about the various things he says in the book, and I would look for a better source on the tragic history of this period. I have read his books on the end of both World War I and World War II which are much better, so that adds to my disappointment"}
{"id": "books-positive-520", "domain": "books", "label": 1, "text": "If you are just starting out on photography, I highly recommend this book. It begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making! For this reason alone, I would give it 5 stars. Here in the first chapter, the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures: the photographer, not the equipment. They then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures (at least, the rest of us non-professionals) turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and high-tech cameras. If you read nothing else but the first chapter alone, I would bet that your photography will already begin to improve. Or if not, the first chapter will at least inspire you to try the suggestions and see the result yourself. In fact, even if all you have is a humble point and shoot film camera, the things they teach in the first chapter are still totally valid, as the principles of good photography remains the same whether you use film or digital. The next chapters give details about camera operations, how to creatively use camera controls, and another great topic, how to tackle different photographic subjects. Just what I needed! I like the chapter on how to process you own film in black and white. Although I'll probably not dive into it, this chapter gives you good grounding on the grassroots of photography. Other good stuff inside: 1. Projects at the end of most every chapter. I dare you to do all the project at chapter one and tell me if it will not improve your understanding of what makes a good picture! 2. Information on digital aspect of photography. Although I shoot film slr, I know that one day, I'll want a digital slr so the info on it is nice. 3. All the illustative pictures are ones that can be done by amateurs! In keeping with the beginner's purpose, this is intentional on the part of the authors. If you are looking for award winning photos or famous photographers, you wont find it here. But the pictures in the book are beautiful in their own right and they drive home the points taught. 4. Modest studio lighting you can create yourself! The principles on the very important aspect of light taught here are very revealing to me. The diagram of how to photograph a subject using only your own flash and any old white card to reflect some light is already a good starting point. However, I am tempted to give this book 4 stars since I felt that despite it's generous information, attractive layout, highly readable text, and wide pages, the authors skimmed the topic on tricky exposure problems. The use of grey cards, spotmeters, and handheld lightmeters to solve these tough light problems were only briefly explained. On the other hand, they provided easily applied solutions to our most common exposure problems. So I give them the benefit of the doubt that such issues correctly belong to advanced photography topics which might only discourage the wobbly beginner if mentioned here. Now that you are aware of it, you will probably do more research on it. Meanwhile, a lot of my pictures are already much improved by the application of the principles in the book alone. I therefore, highly recommend this book to fellow beginners in photography"}

{"id": "books-positive-494", "domain": "books", "label": 1, "text": "Os Guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply. This book is no exception. The fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section. One of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays, all around the central theme of the importance of character. While our culture often acts to create an \"end justifies the means\" behavioral set, never before has character been so important, or so difficult to really practice and live. The book begins with some essays from famous leaders; from Plato to George Washington, Winston Churchill to Machiavelli, and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character, and how it was to be demonstrated. Much of the material is pretty well known, yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort. My favorite sections were on the \"Cultural Erosions of Character\" in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all. From advertising, to media, the pressure to conform is greater than ever, but in some ways has always existed. One of the best essay's in my opinion is called the \"Revenge of Failure\" wherein Henry Fairlie rips the \"legend of our times\", as envy at its worst. No longer content to envy what others have and we do not, we now attempt to destroy in others that which we cannot achieve ourselves. This process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to \"buy\" our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable, but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable. Thus character becomes something that is no longer \"earned\". The sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character. In this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection, the hunter becomes the hunted, and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance. Powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance, are depicted with a convicting clarity. Overall, this is a very well done and thought provoking book. As a study guide it would be ideal for small groups, or even personal reflections. The book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once, or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness. Highly recommended."}

If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault. Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'. For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others. This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out. I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined. That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago.

However, upon opening the book my first thought was, \"these all look like high school yearbook photos\", which is exacltly what they are. It seems that that's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market. His main concern, which he stresses throughout the book, is creating a \"saleable picture\", and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom, since she's usually the one with final say over the pictures. A better title for this book would have been, \"How To Take High School Senior Pictures\". Even then, most of the pictures are not very good, both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book. In addition, the poses are unnatural and awkward looking, and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors. To be fair, the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject, but there is really very little useful information here. So, if you're interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait, this may be the book for you.

Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street. But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as \"my work shows that...\" or \"I demonstrated that...\" even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians. One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing! I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless.

I've found a large number of inconsistencies with history that should be obvious to anyone who has read this thing closely. For example, on page 7 Coleman says \"the Club of Rome was established in 1968\", but on page 17 he suggests that the Club of Rome played \"a key role in the Cuban Missile Crisis\" and \"attempted to sell its 'crisis management'...progam to President Kennedy.\" Unless we've been misled, the Cuban Missile Crisis happened a full 6 years before this group was founded. What are careful readers to make of such a passage? Either it's a typo and he means 1958, or, as I heartily suspect, he doesn't have a grasp on his subject. On page 9 Coleman suggests Henry \"Kissinger's role in destabilizing the United States by three wars, the Middle East, Korea, and Vietnam is well known...\" However, Kissinger, working at Harvard from 1948, had no role in the U.S. government until the 1960's, working for the Kennedy Administration. The Korean War, as we are all aware, occured in 1950, and ended long before Kissinger had any influence on American foreign policy. If it were true that Kissinger had an influence on the United States' policy in Korea, for example, then Coleman would be wise to address that issue at this point in his text. However, he only leaves us with the cryptic \"is well known\". It is definitely NOT well known, and Coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is difficult to read or which is discussing difficult subjects must be true. These are just a few of the inconsistencies that I could check in a short time that Coleman throws out at you. If you're not a careful reader, you'll be tricked into accepting some really ridiculous ideas.

All this really means is that this book has definite longevity (and believe it or not, all of the \"predictions\" in the book are a reality today. Seth Godin set forth to spread his book like a virus to everyone he could through his connections, and their connections, and their connections and \"so on and so on\". The truth is the idea virus is real and his book is living proof that ideas and other products can certainly be spread by word-of-(mouth, email, infrared, download, or whatever). I have always been an admirer of Seth Godin and although I have not read all of his books, I will make certain that I do. He has a keen sense of marketing like no other as in his \"Purple Cow\" as well as this book \"Unleashing the Idea Virus\". Who better to write about spreading ideas around than Seth. His book has certainly hit the circuit and still has a long way to go before absolutely everyone who should read this book (and apply the information). This book is a must for anyone that touches the marketing function in their business. The Idea Virus is a book full of common sense items but with a twist that makes them more realistic than just theory. The real life situations described bring all the points to home. I just hope that the next time I sneeze, a new idea, the targeted hive picks it up and swarms around it and passes it on. I want to own the market in my defined hive and I want it to propagate and live on for a long time. This book is one terrific example! Go download it or purchase it at the bookstore."}

What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption. The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story. The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, \"crashing and bleeding out,\" cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type. The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care? I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to \"get into the minds\" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write. If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone.

For example, he considers how common phrases such as \"go up to the attic\" and \"go down to the basement\" are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends, while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends--in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended. As he does with other such observations, Bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives. In addition to exploring how we experience space and place, Bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight; roughly speaking, he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something. By reading this beautifully written and engaging book, you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived, grown up, felt comfortable or alienated, had a feeling of wonder or fear, etc. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space, in language and what it can reveal to us, or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language"}

{"id": "books-positive-423", "domain": "books", "label": 1, "text": "NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a significant Dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses. The protagonist's experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama, comic relief, political satire, class comedy, social criticism, and domestic farce, they allow Dickens the opportunity to portray, to the minutest nuance, an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics. The main frame of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a quintessential Dickens: a generic, virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate. Nicholas Nickleby has committed no fault and offenses, and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world, to be separated from the people he loves, and to be proscribed like a criminal. The more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life, the more profusely the novel accentuates Dickens' outrage at the cruelty and social injustice. When Nicholas Nickleby is left exiguous after his father's death, he turns to his hard-hearted uncle to solicit succor. But Ralph Nickleby, a most unscrupulous and avarious man he is, demonstrates that he is proof against all appeals of blood and kindred, and is steeled against every tale of distress and sorrows. The man will never fail to exert any resolution or cunning that will promise increase of money for there is scarcely anything he will not have hazarded to gratify his greed. It's not that he is unconscious of the baseness of the means with which he acquires his gains. He cares only for gratification of his passions of avarice and hatred. He might have from the beginning conceived dislike to his nephew whom he brazenly places in Squeers' Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys, as an assistant master. The cruelty of Squeers, who's coarse and ruffian behavior even at his best temper, Nicholas has been an unwilling witness. The filthy condition of the school and the bodily distortion of the boys impart in him a dismal feeling. The thought of being a helper and abettor of such squalid practice fills his with honest disgust and indignation. The cruelties descend upon helpless infancy fuel this rightful indignation in Nicholas, who interferes with the schoolmaster's flogging a boy named Smike and astonishes everyone in school. Not only does Ralph persuade Nicholas' family to renounce him for the atrocities to Squeers of which he is guilty, he also betrays his niece Kate into the company of some libertine men who are clients of his and who speak of her in a most casual, lecherous, ribald and vulgar terms. She is roused beyond all endurance by a profusion of compliments of which coarseness becomes humor and of which vulgarity softens down to the most charming eccentricity. The mutual hatred between uncle and nephew aggravates as Nicholas overhears conversations about his sister. The hidden feud further percolates to the surface and leads to a pitch to its malignity as he tries to rescue a girl from a marriage to which she has been impelled. As the uncle insidiously hatches a scheme to retaliate against his nephew who has in every step of the way interceded and thwarted his plans for mercenary gains, Nicholas entwines with a cast of characters who are humorous, memorable, and true to life. Peripheral to his molding to become a gentleman are episodes of political satire, theatrical success, courtship, family farce, and chicanery. The most significant character is no doubt Smike, whom Nicholas saves from the hellish grip of the schoolmaster and has become his best friend. Nicholas' unfailing love and protectiveness toward the boy accentuates his being the novel's hero, whose domestic virtues, affections, compassion, and delicacy of feelings qualifies him to his later fortune and does him justice. NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a flamboyantly exuberant work in which Dickens wreaks the tension of his social satire to a pitch. Details on the Yorkshire school offer such magnifying vision of the cruelty, filthiness, and despotism in the boarding schools. Nor does he spare the rogues and the greedy, whose squeamishness he sarcastically embellishes as a common honesty and whose pride as self-respect. NICHOLAS NICKLEBY also evokes the subtle problem of human nature in establishing boundary of one's remorse. Although Ralph might feel no remorse in his betraying his niece to the temptation of his libertine clients, he hates them for doing what he has expected them to do. In a sense, Nicholas is seen as the unswerving force that is determined to right the wrong of the society. He tries to appeal to the compassion and humanity of those who have gone astray and to lead them to consider the innocent and the helpless. Nicholas might embody energy for radicalism and ambition to challenge social injustice; his ultimate goal is the recovery of his ancestral position in the social hierarchy. But in the effort to undertake the good deeds, he is influenced by no selfish or personal consideration but by pity for the people he helps and detestation and abhorrence of the heartless schemes. In the same way he is determined to appeal to his uncle's humanity and not to wreak revenge on him. But Ralph's hatred for his nephew has been fed upon his own defeat, nourished on his interference with all his schemes. NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a sober social commentary woven with social and domestic issues. Woven in one man's aspiration to restore family's ancestral dignity is Dickens' own musing, monologues, teachings on the soul, the life, and the moral. The discourse at times assumes a voice of despondency, sobriety and indignation."}

{"id": "books-positive-273", "domain": "books", "label": 1, "text": "In some ways KM Soehnlein's THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS reminded me of the teenage novels of Paul Zindel. There is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time. Zindel wrote specifically for adolescents. Soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among post-pubescent boys and its social implications. Although the book is written for adults, it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us. THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS is the story of a family that falls apart when a tragic accident befalls the youngest child. The story is seen through the eyes of the victim's 13-year-old brother as he tries to find something to hold on to while his mother drifts into alcoholism, his father goes nuts, his sister becomes a religious fanatic (and a kleptomaniac) and he finds himself smitten with two boys. One is Todd, the athletic and arrogant brother of his girl-pal confidante who lives next door. The other is Scott, a boy who deals drugs, cuts school and has an alcoholic father who beats him. All the characters are vividly rendered. If this were ever turned into a film, the actress who plays the mother would probably win an Oscar just for her final scene in the car. This is powerful and emotional writing. I found it very moving. It's tempting to want to recommend this book to a wide audience, but I am reticent because there are several scenes of furtive and unacknowledged sex between teenage boys that could upset some people. But I will never forget this book. Five stars"}

His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia. Rather than a completely coercive state directing the actions of its citizens to some hirer calling, Mr. Galbraith aims to be `practical' and just further defines the third way. Nonetheless, his proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and it is more attuned to the European model of society. Many of his proposals are so silly you won't take them seriously. But sadly, he is quite serious. For example, Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone should have a rewarding life. Of course, he never defines the standard by which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding. Neither does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life. And, of course, who is the `rewarding life judge' and does this judge have the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too un-rewarding.

At first glance the layout might seem confusing, even distracting, yet it somehow works here. Neil Gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing. He introduces us to a charming young girl named Lucy, who suspects something is not right with her home. And though her pig-puppet seems to share her concern and understands her fear, the rest of her family do not...until it's too late. The action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end, though perhaps it is not. You be the judge.

In this case, he effectively employs the seemingly paradoxical book of Ecclesiastes. This book of the Bible finds its author searching for more in life. In the end, the author finds that it is not so much the end as the journey itself that has importance. Kushner's overall point is best summarized on page 189. Does it make a difference if I am honest, good, or faithful? It does not seem to matter to my bank account or fortune. \"... It matters if we are true to ourselves, to our innate human nature that requires things like honesty and kindness and grows flabby and distorted if we neglect them. It matters if we learn how to share our lives with others, making them and their world different, rather than try and hoard life to ourselves. It matters than we learn to recognize the pleasures of every day, food and work and love and friendship, as encounters with the divine, encounters that teach us not only that God is real but that we are real too.\" It is a simple yet beautiful message.

Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good. I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In \"Zen\" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology. The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page 17: \"The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower.\" That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of \"quality.\" I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.

There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking, but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader. Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia, thence to Britain to the US and ending in France. Again, there is no context. He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist, to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book. If viewed as a book about collecting books, you will not learn much. If viewed as a memoir, there was little that was interesting about the author's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions. There were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector, but they were too few and far between.

{"id": "books-negative-112", "domain": "books", "label": 0, "text": "I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book. For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus. Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original. The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning. However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book. In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how \"Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee.\" If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to \"stick it\" to Alcott: \"ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now!"}

But then at times that made the book more entertaining - its acerbic opinion of the right, how Reagan getting elected made her feel stupid about being American, a funny British couple. The description of small details from each of the characters' childhood was something I could relate to because i think of that myself. There were clever tidbits from anthropology, and economics, and generally all fields of intellectual inquiry, all somehow connected with the patchwork of love and relationships, and thus brain meets heart and you end up with something almost like the Bible for our times. The focus on the main character made it so that every detail about him was described. Anyway, I am rambling, so, a note about the ending: I did find myself thinking this is getting very strange as the book got towards the ending. It might have made more sense if Nelson actually was interested in the new girl the narrator finds for him, and the story then comes full circle. It would end in a nice ironic sort of way. However, his rejecting her makes in my mind for what would be a bad traditional ending. I don't mind this, since the one time I wrote a story for a creative writing course I ended up with a terrible traditional ending. Now, could he have been anything other than a mystic? I felt that there was some hint towards Hinduism and spirituality building up towards the end. He mentioned India and Hinduism unexpectedly and repeatedly at one point in the book. So his becoming a mystic was alluding perhaps to the ashramas - and his transition from intellectual worker to a mystical worker to eventually a sage, as he attains Nirvana and becomes the Buddha of our times. So in this way an ending emphasizing the spiritual, is perhaps the best. In line with the book, the spiritual is the eternal, and only accessible through life-changing (near-death) experience. What you do from 25-50 (making a model village in rural Africa) is transient (can never be perfect; infighting; hunting; guns; the \"dark-side\" of human nature will come back even in Utopia; i like the flexible hours; work when you want; accumulate credits; do manual labor once in a while; start the day with reading , not the end when you are tired; siesta, fiesta etc.) no matter how good you are. The girl herself is secondary to the book - ironic since the book promotes feminism, is written by a guy with a female narrator but a male protagonist, who she is fixated on and has doubts about. But in the end the Jesus character is still male. While the female goes back to Palo Alto and takes an average job in service of the savior. The Man has the final laugh.

Gage does things a little differently than anyone else, which is something I quickly discovered when reading this book. This book is brash, to the point and filled with insight and inspiration. I thought that Gage presented his points in a well thought out manner that really took the establishment on head on. Many points presented in the book are in other personal development books. However, I don't know of any book that has all these points in one book. Even Gage himself admits in an interview that this is a combination of Think and Grow Rich, The Secret, Ayn Rand and several other books and cd's. A lot of it you have heard before, like if you say you are broke, then you will always be broke. However, I didn't realize how much the mainstream media and the political establishment are contributing to our negative, broke thoughts. Most frightening of all, I learned why the establishment needs us to be broke in order to keep their power. I am taking Randy's lead and watching less TV, especially the news. That's the worst of all! There is also a nice introduction to Libertarianism and the works of Ayn Rand. As a Libertarian myself, I was delighted to see this included in the book. With recent reports circulating about Britain on the verge of becoming a police state, this warning about big government couldn't have come at a more appropriate time. As expected, Randy does make a plug for MLM, but this is by no means an MLM book. The MLM plug is just a few short pages. However, it is still a nice resource for MLM people to use for third party credibility. He also mentioned real estate and information marketing as good businesses as well. I must be smart, healthy and rich, as I am already involved in all three. I found myself nodding in agreement to this book. I also found a lot of places where I was thinking, \"Oh, I'm not the only one who this this way. Why hasn't this been mentioned before in the press?\" Other times, I thought, \"Oh my god, I am being really manipulated here.\" While he was \"preaching to the choir\" with me, I'm sure that many people with more \"mainstream\" views will feel more challenged reading this book. Bottom line, if you love MLM get 10 copies of this book, if you support the Libertarians, get 10 copies of this book. If you are like me and love them both, get 25 copies.

{"id": "books-negative-642", "domain": "books", "label": 0, "text": "I give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented, \"DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson.\" This most difinitive \"unproven\" statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he \"seems\" to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what \"reason\" he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers. He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. Unless I overlooked it, I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity. I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA sources. The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians,(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon. From what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A. Foster with the DNA study), Mr. Wade's analysis of this is extremely limited, in fact, it is extremely biased. \"Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings\" (pg 257). What truthful fact does he have to give this statement? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co., Ohio. Why the details in a book topic such as this? I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion. As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books, these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales. He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges. You may read on my web page: www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study. He cannot plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion. Can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge. My knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited, BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no current or original research. He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of \"authority\" on the controversy. She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson's grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words. To add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking, Wade has a figure with the title, \"Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings.(Pg.260-261).\" His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters (an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct. He does not mention a very scholarily book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry, \"Anatomy of a Scandal, Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story\", who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging. Since he did not give the reader another source for study, another VERY interesting book, \"Jefferson Vindicated, Falacies, Omissions,and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search\", I will tell you it has a foreword by former Monticello Director, James A, Bear, Jr. All of the named books, including, \"The Jefferson-Hemings Myth\" are available through Amazon. I do agree with Wade's last sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy.......\"Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve.\" I might add that contrived history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of \"another\" Hemings DNA source.....only ONE originally tested.

I initially picked it up because as an actor I find biographies or autobio's about somewhat lesser known people more curious than approaching someone like Paul Newman or Brando, who each have several books...And Gazzara's career has been an intruiging one. As a member of the Actors Studio, which produced the aforementioned actors along with countless others, his rise to Broadway and Hollywood was quick. He originated Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and played his first film for Otto Preminger-opposite James Stewart and George C. Scott, among others-in Anatomy of a Murder. But his approach to acting, which is of primary importance to me, was not chronicled. Instead he regales with stories of what and who the people he worked with were like. What the particular country he was shooting in was like, etc., etc. One of his primary sources of regard is his work with John Cassavetes, and it is clear Cassavetes was a major influence and close friend, someone Gazzara owes much, and the process by which they created Husbands and other films is investigated more than any other. Cassavetes too comes out as a more interesting, Larger Than Life guy, while Gazzara's tales of living in Italy, or being in Spain, New York, Hollywood, the Philippines, etc., etc. just made me jealous...

I picked up David Sacks' book from Borders' Linguistics stack because of the title. I should have known better. I started the first chapter and didn't have the time or intention to finish it. The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of alphabetic writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks, in my opinion, systematic thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of alphabetic writing that is found in other scholarly works (scholarly it is not). Even within the first 20 pages or so, I was disawayed more than a few times by dubious claims, utter misinformation, and distastefully Euro/English-centric. Here are some examples: \"The alphabet was not the earliest writing: Egypt, Mesopotamia, and probably China already had nonalphabetic systems. But the alphabet was the most efficient writing system ever found, before or since (p.1)\" -- What about Hirogana for Japanese? Syllabaries can be much more efficient for languages that do not have a large inventory of syllables. \"The 'spreadability' of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very bright indeed. (p. 10)\" -- He was speaking of languages that are written in multiple alphabets, such as Swahili, Serbo-Croatian, Urdu/Hindi, and Yiddish. And then came this proud comment on the prospect \"our Roman letters\". Immediately following the above quote, he gave examples of Azerbaijian and Tatarstan's decision to switch to Roman, as well as other \"struggling nation\"'s likewise decisions to \"switch to Roman letters for native tongues, as a big to tie into global trade and communications and to better prepare their prople to learn English. Tragically, much that is venerable and spiritually sustaining while be lost. Yet that seems inevitable in the 21st century were are shaping. And it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield such power.\" His view of the learnability of the alphabet is also uneducated, shall I say. The following superficial comment could have come from an old gradama who happened have NOT been a teacher for her lifetime. \"An alphabet enjoys on huge advantage over any other writing system: It needs fewer symbols. No other sysmtem can get away with so few. This makes an alphabet easier to learn. Students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy, which typically takes about another five years of instruction\". And -- he writes -- because of this simplicity, children can become literate before the working age. \"This cricial fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy. (p.5)\" Well, \"vehicle\" is a very clevery way of framing it. At least he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is mass literacy. Mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution. Now Sacks joins the ranks of you-know-who's by implying that the Europeans and Western ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from God. (Guns, what guns?) Sacks also compared \"our 26 letters\" -- as if alphabetic writing is patented at the USPO -- to Chinese. \"Today Chinese schoolchildren normally take three years longer than Western children to learn to read and write, with most of that extra time devoted to mastering the symbols.\" This is completely misinformation. Learning to read Chinese is not easy, but do a little research, you will find studies over studies and books over books on comparitive studies of literacy (including my own). I've nevery seen a credible study that substantiates the 3-year lag. By the way, Sacks almost never gives citations. I think that's enough. This explains my total disappointment with the book -- I sholdn't have any high expectation from the start, had I known who David Sacks is."}

I'm not sure where your numbers come from, as your logic seems tenuous, at best, but according to that left-wing, liberal think tank known as the US Census Bureau, Rowe-Finkbeiner is right. And it's getting worse. The Census Bureau reported in August, based on the Current Population Survey, that women's real median earnings fell by $171, or 0.6 percent, from 2002 to 2003, while men's increased by $336, or 0.8 percent. (The increase for men was not statistically significant, but the decrease for women was.) The gender wage ratio thus fell to 75.5, compared with 76.6 in 2002. In addition, a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released in October of 2003, controlling for changes in education and work experience over time, concludes that women\u001as earnings have remained stagnant, relative to men's, for an even longer period--17 years--with a gap that cannot be explained by measurable differences in education and experience. If you actually read The F-Word, you might find cited cases like this: Although women make up nearly 3/4 of Wal-Mart's workforce, men hold 90% of management positions--despite female employee's receiving better performance evaluations overall--and female employees are paid lower wages than male employees for the same jobs. None of this is disputed by the corporation. Why? According to Wal-Mart, because men are there for a career, while women are working for pocket money. I wish I could say your attitude was merely naive--but the truth is it's far more dangerous and insidious. Thanks to Rowe-Finbeiner for telling it how it really is."}

{"id": "books-negative-405", "domain": "books", "label": 0, "text": "As a professional, certified chef and baker, I am also an avid baking and cookbook collector. After seeing that this book won and the James Beard and the 'IACP Cookbook of the Year' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the 'too good to be true'-reviews on Amazon -some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if Peter Reinhart is the Jesus Christ of Bread- I finally decided to buy this expensive book. What a dissappointment! For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread, wake up! Reinhart's book is simply flawed. Compared to other bread books, it's even a quite average book. But one that is luxuriously packaged. A lot of hot colorful expensive air. And it's expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it, but because of the super luxuriously editing. This is a book for book enthousiasts, not for bakers, professional or home. I see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools, as information and inspiration. Not as eye candy. If you want nice pictures, buy an art book. A book on baking bread with these awards behind it, should give you tons of new info about ingredients and techniques, original insights, an appetite for baking, factual info, the newest and tested developments in technique... What you get here is a fluffed up egotrip. 47 formulas and ample bread info packaged into a shining 30-40$ publishing hype. Don't get me wrong: this is a beautiful, expensive book. But one you don't use in the kitchen, and certainly don't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about. But as a source of new information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge, giving pointers about using new bread ingredients combined with old proven bread baking techniques, as a working tool sweating near the hot oven at home or at a bakery, compared to other bread books, this book fails miserably info-wise. But it has a snappy lay out. Jeff Hamelmans 'Bread, a Book of Techniques' and Rose Beranbaums 'Bread Bible' give the readers much more practical info and insight into bread baking. They talk more about the subject 'bread'. And not about themselves like Peter Reinhart clearly relishes. Mr Reinhart clearly sees himself as so important and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in Paris. How about the bread info, the kneading, rising, baking, ingredient- and techniques info? I honestly prefer industrious bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin. Bakers with such big ego's that think that readers of a Bread Baking book are more interested in the shopping experiences of the wife during 'a learning trip' to professional bakers on which she accompanied him, than in another bread formula's, should work in shobizz, not in a bakery or a culinary school. Big ego's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry. Reinart is, judging by this book, sadly also one of them. I don't see in a 1000 years Rose Beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands prefered color of ties or Jeff Hamelman writing in a bread book about the time he spent with his wife in Paris. Mr.Reinhart: your readers forked out 30-40$ for bread info, not your personal travel experiences. As you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil: Stay with the subject! And the subject of this book, for which I paid is 'Bread and Baking. If we want to know about your personal life, we'll read an interview in People, if they find you interesting enough. Peter Reinharts 'The Bread Baker's Apprentice' as a 'Bread Book' is simply a marketing creation. Smartly edited, but way too short on substance. There is not much new information on bread. Worse: there is not much info at all! In total for 30-40 $, you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for other books by Ten Speed Press, the editor or this book. Compared to Beranbaums 640 pages, Hamelmans 400 plus pages, that is a big difference for a big price. With Reinharts book, you get a lot of shining white surface that in other Bread books is filled with bread info. As a buyer of this book, you also pay for full page black-and-white and color pictures that are pure filler. See p. 3, 6, 26... And why is the beautiful model Fumie on the cover of a bread book and not mr. Reinhart himself or even ... bread alone? With Reinharts next book they will no doubt put Kate Moss in an apron and a bakers vest. Package the air attractive enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the 30-40$. Never mind the content. Let's talk a bit about the formula's. That should be an important part of a baking book, right? And they should be original and fine tuned, right? Sadly to say: nothing new or original here. Some aren't even fine tuned. And baking is all about fine tuning. Worse, almost all the formula's can be found in other bread books. And, most insulting for a buyer of this book, a lot of the mere 47 formulas (Reinhart uses this expensive word because 'recipe' propably doesn't fit into the marketing of this baking book) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from Reinharts former book 'Crust and Crumb'. Clever marketing and ba-da-bing! By the way, 'Crust and Crumb' has been reedited in 2006. At a fair price, I admit. So if you want your dose of Reinhart at a right price without the pomp, sc�nes of a marriage, without Peter Reinharts comment on the Eiffel tower so to speak... buy 'Crust and Crumb' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves. But before I buy I would also first flip through Beranbaums and Hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the Amazon shop. As for this book, you should ask yourself: 'Do I want a serious bread book or a nice coffeetable book?'. Taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews, as a baking book for the world market, this book is almost worthless. The universal accepted working standard in worldwide baking is metric weight. Like it or not, but that's a fact. You weigh your ingredients carefully by grams, kilo's etc. Reinhart visited French top bakers Poilane and Gosselin, clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking. I don't think that Poilane measures in cups and ounces! But even then, let Reinhart measure in cups for the home market. But then have the decency to add the metric equivalent in the formula's itself for the rest of the world. This guy goes on and on about his wish to bake authentic European inspired bread like ciabatta, fougasse... About a Worldwide Bread Revolution! And then he refuses to use the most important tool to make these breads: the same language, the metric weight system. Rose Beranbaum places the metric equivalent next to the cups/ounces. It's a simple as that. Bread is a world food, so use the world standard for baking. If not, market your book mainly to the USA market and be honest and upfront about that. And don't give us that inflated hot air babble about a Worldwide Bread Revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard, the metric wieght system! This big flaw makes the book almost useless for bakers outside the USA. The Worldwide Bread Revolution won't be for tommorrow if we have to use this book worldwide! Next point: Reinhart advocates instant yeast over fresh pressed yeast. Every baker worth his salt (or yeast) will tell you that fresh yeast gives a far better taste, volume and texture. Yeast is a living organism. As 'instant yeast' it has been dried and put on the shelves for God knows how long. It's like you force a just woken up coma-patient, that has been dormant for months, years... to run a marathon. Fresh, pressed yeast is still alive and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to 'instant' (aka dried) yeast. Try the difference between fresh yeast and instant yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home, and judge for yourself. To place fresh yeast on the same level as instant yeast is preposterous for someone like Reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments! For scientific back up, you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist Herve This 'Molecular Gastronomy, Exploring the Science of Flavor' (Columbia University Press 2006). And it gets worse. Reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or olive oil in his breads. If Poilane hears this, he'll drop dead! Every baker knows that even a small amount of butter gives a much better taste and texture than shortening. Shortening produces a rancid/metallic taste and a slimy, unpleasant mouthfeel. Not to talk about health. Most shortening is choc full of trans fats which are much more unhealty than butter fat. Read Harvard's nutrition professor Walter Willets book: 'Eat, Drink and be Healthy' (Free Press 2001). New York has already picked this info up. Professional food writer and teacher Reinhart hasn't or doesn't care. For instance, Reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in Italian bread you can use shortening instead of olive oil. In Italian Bread! Come on, let's be serious. And this guy teaches at the Culinary Institute of America! It's like he is advocating spam to put on the BBQ instead of beef! If that is the standard of baking that Reinhart uses, he'll have to wait a long time to reach the standards of a Poilane. Then there is Reinharts Hygi�ne Problem. There is an international standard for basic hygiene in food called the Hazzard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP). Reinhart as a professional tutor and teacher must no doubt know the HACCP by heart. The first thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns, is that before even touching ingredients, he must remove all the rings on his fingers. Because the place underneath a wedding band for instance, is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast. And kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on, is not only very dangerous for the health of customers, it is simply not done for a baker. I like my bread without filth baked in, thank you very much! In the school where I earned my diplome in baking, if a student had a ring on during practical class, he had to leave the class immediately and he lost important points for his exam. Yet we see professional teacher and Bread Book Author Reinhart kneading dough WITH HIS WEDDING BAND ON! See p. 36-37, 82-83, 255, 245... Unforgivable in a 'professional' baking book. And all the more in an expensive book that won the James Beard and IACP awards! Has anyone of the juries of the James Beard Foundation and the IACP, any basic knowledge of food hygiene? Has nobody seen this cardinal sin against food hygi�ne in a so called 'professional Bread Book'? One other thing, for a bread book that pretends to be world class, there is no word about gluten-free bread. Not one formula. And this while more and more people are allergic to gluten (protein in wheat flour). To end on a positive note, one thing I found acceptable in this expensive coffee table book, was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread. But, fellow reviewers, you can find all this info and more, and explained more clearly, more detailed and to the point, in Hamelmans 'Bread' and Beranbaums 'Bread Bible'. And it doesn't take 55 pages of expensive high quality shining white paper. Peter, take out all the white empty space, learn to write more clearly and to the point, and you can say the same thing in 20 pages. Which leaves you 35 pages for more formula's for example. But if you haven't any formula's left or are preparing a new book, then, yes, by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20. Why make it simple if you can make it seem difficult, impress your not so knowledgable readers and in doing so stroking your own ego? So despite all the hoopla, hyped reviews, near hysterical praise and important awards, this is simply a too expensive, show off-book. It's like the tale of 'the King with no Clothes on'. Somebody has to yell: 'Hey, wait a minute!' If you want good books on bread baking: buy one by Jeff Hamelman, Rose Beranbaum and Bernard Clayton. You don't get a model on the cover, but the content is all the better. And in a bread book, isn't content more important than packaging"}

The music as music is quite good, but it doesn't lead the film in any direction, so it's not helping. The story is recycled, which is good, but could have been much more minimalistic. Why not just have the party and let the miner kill the kids? And trying to put a twist to the story by \"explaining\" things is seldom very helpful.

And unfortunately, it is some of her worst acting work, posey, sing-song, and superficial. Now, if you've read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static. Like most Heburn films, a highlight is her clothes, her style, her self. This film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better. There are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here. This film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead. Jayne Mansfield could have been a hoot in this, Thelma Ritter too, in a very different way, somebody with less style and more off beat snap, crackle, and pop. (Thelma Ritter and William Holden paired in a romantic comedy... I'm all ready laughing!) Before I hit this too harshly, this film was intended to be a trifle, the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles. For that, it is adequate. The remake, ALEX AND EMMA suffers very much from the same problems. They actually improved the script, and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices, but both films seem to have suffered from \"settling for a star\" when a less mainstream, more zany actress was needed. OK, this doesn't stink...it has Audrey, but it certainly doesn't sizzle"}

His trio record set the standard in the early days, with Bright Size Life (w. Jaco and Bob Moses), and his PMG work has been unusual and different and refreshing. One reviewer mentions \"cheesy tunes\" - in what sense? In the sense that they don't conform to a rigid set of jazz sounds that we've come to expect (swing+sax+trumpet+upright bass + x y and z=jazz)? Great jazz musicians are innovators, and what PMG has done consistently through its life and continues to do is to create it's own genre of music unto itself - completely unique. Are you going to find 14 other groups sounding like this? No way. Not even one. I know cheesy music when I hear it, and there are plenty of so-called mainstream jazz artists that are guilty of it in addition to the usual suspects. Most jazz musicians will be remembered as that guy or gal that sounded kind of like Miles or kind of like Coltrane or Brecker or whatever. The great ones are the ones others are compared TO, and Pat Metheny falls in that category. If you are open-minded to creative music and want to enjoy great musicians at the top of their game, creating art together as a team listening well and bringing fresh new ideas to life, then buy or rent this DVD. If you want to hear what one kid from Missouri who was by age 15 determined to play with Gary Burton (and he did) was able to do with the guitar by just doggedly pursuing it year after year, creating fresh new material, taking the beauty of the guitar to new levels each and every year, then listen to this DVD and be a part of his history. Because Pat is one of the true geniuses of our age. His relationship with Lyle Mays persists to this day - what a story of loyalty working together though a lifetime. And Pat is able to draw more talent out of his musicians than most bandleaders. A lot of jazz artists have used Richard Bona over the years as a talented fretless bass player, but Pat Metheny gave him a stage to share the whole range of his talent. He does a solo with himself and some percussion and a delay pedal that is amazing - he harmonizes with himself and creates a tapestry of sound... Cuong Vu did something similar on this DVD with his trumpet. The drummer and bass player (Antonio Sanchez and Steve Rodby)are just on it - this is a great band. If you get a chance to hear their Austin City Limits performance, I think it is slightly better in the sense of how raw it is; this performance is more polished, and of course a lot more time was taken in the mastering of this. Both live performances are worth checking out."}

Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're hampered by two things: 1.) The film's slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE! 2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can't be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It's too bad, because these elements could've made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named \"Alafair\" by the Robichouxs, after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie's ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: \"I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would've been the sexiest picture of '96!\" To be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there's just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin & Co. could've dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke's books instead."}

I've watched this movie on my 40\" LCD Sony XBR BRAVIA (720 dpi), an OPPO upscaling DVD player, and 5.1 sound system, and for this movie, I didn't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version. So unless they're selling this Superbit version for 10 bucks or less (which seems to be the trend since Superbit discs may become moot now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs are starting to come out), I'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie, which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers"}

{"id": "dvd-positive-546", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "\"Cinderella II: Dreams Come True\" is a series of three stories featuring mostly characters from the original Cinderella and a few new ones. The animation is amazing --- it's filled with lush color (except for muted color when the story calls for it) and the animation looks very polished. It's really a sight to see. The three stories in this are called, according to the closing credits --- \"Aim To Please,\" \"Tall Tail\" and \"An Uncommon Romance.\" These stories are all tied together with the idea that the Fairy Godmother is helping the mice to make a storybook about the adventures of them and Cinderella since the time that Cinderella met the Prince. The very first story finds Cinderella arriving at the castle after her honeymoon. The Prince is forced to rush away on important state business and Cinderella is left in charge of the royal banquet/ball. She has no idea what she's supposed to do and so this woman named Prudence is assigned to help her out. But will Cinderella be able to pull this together in time and in a way that will please the King? The second story, \"A Tall Tail\" finds Cinderella in preparation for the Spring Festival. Jaq wants to help out, but it seems like Cinderella no longer has any time for him. He makes a wish to become human. The final story contains the surprising premise that Cinderella's stepsister Anastasia is falling in love with a breadmaker at market. The Evil Stepmother forbids this romance, but Cinderella decides to show Anastasia that even she can have a dream come true. The voice talent is amazing. They did a great job of casting people who made the voices sound just like the original film. Unless you're really listening hard, you'll be hard-put to notice any difference at all. The music in this film is a combination of themes from the original and a few new songs performed by Brooke Allison. I'd never heard anything by Brooke Allison before (that I know of), but she's an amazing artist. Perhaps the most surprising piece is the closing credits number (also featured as a music video) --- a techno version of \"Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo\" called \"Put it Together.\" It works quite well. Another great song is \"Follow Your Heart.\" For a Disney sequel, this DVD also has some nice special features. There's the aforementioned music video, which features entirely of clips from the film, rather than the recording session by Brooke Allison. However, you do get to see some of the recording in the Musical Magical Featurette, which also includes an examination of the film's score by the composer. There's a Cinderella Storybook, which allows you to read a story about Jaq and Mary with or without narration. The Enchanted Castle game is fairly simple, but not too bad --- you get to help with the decoration and cleanup of Cinderella's castle, preparing a meal and dressing Cinderella. There's also a DVD-ROM game called Cinderella's Dollhouse. Finally, of course, this DVD has the usual previews/trailers for other movies, but perhaps not so usual. This is a great set of trailers. There's a promo for the \"Beauty and the Beast\" Special Edition DVD in which they talk about how they inserted \"Human Again\" into the film. Also including in this set is a neat Disney DVD \"Pure Digital Magic\" promo that I had never seen before. This DVD is truly a worthy edition to the Disney Cinderella story.

Prior to viewing \"What's New Pussycat?\", I would have presumed that I would enjoy each and every movie. However, \"What's New Pussycat?\" has shown me that even Woody Allen can make a disaster movie. What is wrong with this movie is just about everything. The acting can only do so much with an impossibly awful script and a director who seems to want to magnify the faults rather than cover them up. We start with a man whose problem is that he must seduce every acttractive woman he sees. Peter O'Toole won the rights to play this character and he is surrounded by beautiful women. He proceeds to make it all seem so boringly ridiculous. He calls all his femine friends \"pussycat\" which gets old after a while. He constantly displays a bewildered expression coupled with a rather interested/disinterested approach toward his playmates. He seeks the help of a sexually challenged psychiatrist played by Peter Sellers. Sellers does his best with what little he has to work with. He has the Dr. Strangelove accent down pretty good and he is constantly on the make but the humor that emerges is so weak as to be embarassing at times. Woody Allen wrote the script, which is the most shocking disappointment of the whole picture. I once heard a comedian remark that a good comic writer can give you 10 new jokes of which you can use 3. With Woody Allen, the comedian said, you can use all 10. In \"What's New Pussycat?\", I wish there HAD been at least three good jokes. This overlong look into the problems that O'Toole's character suffers from eventually attempts to save itself with a sort of Bennie Hill-style slapstick. I take that back; there's no justifiable reason to besmirch the good name of Bennie Hill by associating it with this turkey. Anyway, the movie ends in a chateau with a sort of musical beds involving all of O'Toole's mistresses. An incomprehensible brouhaha ensues and the revelers escape to a neighboring go-kart track. (Presumeably all fashional French Chateaus have a conveniently adjacent go-kart track). This enables the movie to sink so low that it boggles the mind. After all, we have some top talent in Allen, Sellers and O'toole and we see them spontaneously go go-kart-riding off into the sunset (or the side of a building, or a mud puddle, or something meant to be funny). I was glad to be done with the movie. Woody Allen is a great talent. Peter Sellers was a great talent. Peter O'Toole was a great talent.

It has been color corrected by Scorsese himself, and remastered for superior sound quality. The concert on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 was the final concert of The Band, with its original lineup. Numerous special musical guests enhanced the occasion. The Band were clearly at the top of their game that night, despite whatever personal tensions may have existed between them. Classic songs like \"Up on Cripple Creek\", \"Stage Fright\",and \"They Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" are given excellent rendtions. The guest stars seem to be having a good time, with backing by The Band themselves. Ronnie Hawkins does an outstanding \"Who Do You Love\". Dr. John does his classic \"Such A Night\". Joni Mitchell performs her underrated \"Coyote\". A high-kickin' Van Morrison rocks the house with \"Caravan\". And blues legend Muddy Waters does a spectacular \"Mannish Boy\". In a \"making of\" featurette, Scorsese says Waters' perforance of this song was almost not filmed, because most of the cameras ran out of film. Fortunately, one cameraman caught the whole song, so we can have this excellent performance. Neil Young, Eric Clapton,and Bob Dylan are just some of the other performers in this outstanding lineup. Scorsese also provides excellent behind the scenes interviews with the members of The Band. The DVD also incudes two commentaries. One features Scorsese and Robbie Robertson, the other features Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, and guests stars Hawkins and Mavis Staples.

The commentaries are just about as funny as the episodes as the three creators continue to riff on each other, giving some insight into the creation process, while remaining pretty well aware their show met with sub-par ratings. They take it all in stride and aren't too proud to poke fun at themselves. I think if this show had been on comedy central around the time Strangers with Candy was on it would have been given atleast three seasons. It's a shame. Definitely worth getting, turning off your phone, and spending a whole night plowing through the whole season. \"And when I say plow that's a pun!"}

Jane Fonda's role in Barbarella comes to mind. This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend. But the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen (cast as Gwendoline) apparently balked at doing girl/girl scenes (this was 1984, after all), and so the producers obligingly didn't force her to do any, and as a result this one turned into a very bland, weak, and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's not a good adventure film, and it's certainly not erotic. There's a little nudity, and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics, but overall this one was a disappointing bust."}

Good call. I don't know if the ending was better than the original, but it was certainly a very good, interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake.

{"id": "dvd-negative-206", "domain": "dvd", "label": 0, "text": "How High is a film that lends nothing, I repeat, nothing to the film community at large. I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech & Chong of the new millennium with the Redman/Method Man pairing. While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film, very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be. When I use the word racist, I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clich�s that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society. While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring, what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community, but also to their own culture. I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films, but this one left my jaw on the floor several times. The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan, but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face. Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clich�s that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film. Nothing was original. Nothing was exciting. Was the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions? I think not. As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film, the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers, but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought. Why? Method Man and Redman, who completely different people, were nothing more than the same character in this film. With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter, nothing could separate the equality of these two characters. That is why they failed as a comic team. Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech & Chong, what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned? What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together. Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together, but with Method Man and Redman, they were the same. I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film. What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive. What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman/Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters. The clich� jock, the clich� frat boy, the clich� Asian (which was again another racist moment), and the clich� rich white boy, just felt and were old. Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations, but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality. How High, from beginning to end, was anything but original. I must admit, after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to, I don't want to go to Harvard. They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage. How High is a dark spot in Harvard's history. Do you know what makes it even worse? This film wasn't even created at or anywhere near Harvard. Again, Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film. How High has no redeeming qualities. Ooops, I stand corrected. The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke. How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film? I have said it once, I will say it again, some actors just need their bills paid. Inconsistency, incompetence, and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud. What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general, it is nothing. There is no original story at all with How High. Going to college, working for your grades, winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute - this was nothing short of a \"cut and paste\" film that had no backbone and horrid acting! I do not like Jesse Dylan's style of directing. While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film (due greatly to Will Ferrell), all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes. The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example. The Benjamin Franklin moments is another. The unconcluded \"Truth Serum\" can be considered another. How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency. Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated! I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan. If he would have tightened the script, created unique and \"cult-like\" characters, and eliminated the racism, he may have had the quintessential \"weed\" film in Hollywood. Now, all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for. Sad. Overall, this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed. Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High. The actors, all around, were horrible. The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age, this film would never be considered a comedy. Nothing was funny. Nothing will make you laugh. The only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits. The ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life. Grade: * out of ****"}
{"id": "dvd-positive-779", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "Bergman first introduced us to Johan and Marianne in his 1974 masterpiece Scenes from a Marriage, one of the cinema's most exacting dissections of our all-too-human failure to connect. Bergman and the splendid Scandanavian actors Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann took us through Johan and Marianne's marriage, divorce, and post-divorce reconciliation. In the end, they live apart, but still make room for the bond between them. Three decades later, Bergman, Josephson and Ullmann have given us Saraband, a late-life gift. Marianne decides that even though she hasn't seen Johan since the 1970s, it's time to make contact again. Johan has inherited money from an aunt, and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake. She literally wakes him with a kiss, but soon enough Marianne's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in Johan's family. Henrik, Johan's son, is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter Karin. Both of them still mourn Anna, Henrik's wife and Karin's mother, who died two years before. Henrik, a music teacher, is preparing Karin, an accomplished cellist, for her conservatory entrance exams. The elderly Johan remains cold-hearted but charismatic (not unlike Bergman's own father) and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him. Henrik wants his father's affection and acceptance, even though Johan refuses to give it, ostensibly due to some slight by Henrik when he was 19 years old. In a painful scene, Henrik goes to Johan to ask for money to help Karin, and in his 61 year old face, we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his self-absorbed father. For Karin, her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father. Karin struggles to figure out what she owes Henrik, what she owes to the memory of her mother, and what she owes to herself. She lets Marianne see some, but not all, of the turmoil she's going through. For Marianne, her attraction to Johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him. She's always wanted something from him, but since she can't define what it is, she'll probably never get it. The struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by Marianne's opening and closing monologues. Karin makes her choices. Henrik reacts. Marianne throws herself once more against Johan's emotional aloofness. As he's done throughout his brilliant career, Bergman brings it alive through artful dialog, perfect dramatic timing, and riveting cinematic composition. The characters are not always likable, but they are never less than engrossing. The Criterion's DVD includes a mini-documentary of Bergman making Saraband. We watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking, kid around with the crew, poke and prod his actors into position. It's a treat to watch him work. One wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from Julia Dufvenius, the fine young actress who plays Karin. One also wonders why Bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he'd announced he was through. Bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection. Apparently he wants to say one last thing about it, which seems to be this: after all the tears and shouting, all the posturing and cruelty, all the reaching out and pulling back, this is what remains: marriages of true minds (the photo of Anna used in the film is a picture of Bergman's great love, his deceased wife Ingrid); the fraught ties of fathers and sons; memories of old loves; what you give and get from children; and the devolution of the flesh. None of it is easy, the master tells us, but all of it is necessary. In the end, it's all you have. What's truly sad is that Bergman, sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey, claims that he's done. He did for film what Shakespeare did for theater, took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving. He will certainly be missed and he can't be replaced. But don't see Saraband for nostalgic reasons. It's a moving, insightful film that deserves a place in the director's canon. Saraband stands on its own, but it's a deeper experience if you watch Scenes from a Marriage first."}
{"id": "dvd-positive-205", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "Welcome to the Lower East Side, where the high-rise apartments of the super-rich abut the tenements on the riverside. Here Joel McCrea, a poor would-be architect, is infatuated with rich girl Wendy Barrie, while poor girl Sylvia Sidney pines for him, all the while trying to save her younger brother from a life of crime on the streets. Into the scene strides Humphrey Bogart as a wanted killer, coming home to try to reconnect with his mother and an old flame. Intersecting with the adult storyline is that of the Dead End Kids (in what would be the first of many screen appearances), of which Sidney's brother is the leader. The film is based on a play, and boy can you tell. The studio set is deeply obvious as such, and the structure is too carefully symmetrical. The social symbolism is subtle as a sledgehammer, and the script is too caught up with being Worthy. Bogart's performance is a striking one, however, and his character stands out as fully realized when compared to the walking Social Messages incarnated by Sidney and McCrea. The Dead End Kids (also known as the East Side Kids, the Bowery Boys, and the Little Tough Guys) would show again the following year in Angels with Dirty Faces, and viewing the two films together is instructive, showing, among other things, the difference between MGM's gloss (which sat uneasily on a gangster story) and Warner's far more convincing grit. The mono track is in good shape. The print is in pretty good shape, but there's no hiding the fact that this is a film from 1937. The trailer is here, and nothing else. The menu is basic. Once celebrated with Oscar nominations, this film now seems rather silly compared to the Warner gangster films of the same period.

Deever is a good guy, smart enough but ambitious only on his own terms. He's sort of engaged to his best friend's sister, but he's had a crush on Sokolow for two years. When the man in the building gets his throat slit, Sokolow is one of the reporters on the scene. Deever sees a perfect chance to get to meet her, so he tells her he may know something. She goes after the story and he goes after her. Sokolow is not quite engaged to a dedicated, capable man known as Joseph (Christopher Plummer), who is good friends with Sokolow's parents. It becomes clear that her wealthy parents, their rich friends and Joseph are engaged in the shadowy business of buying illegal ways for Jews to escape from the Soviet Union and to journey to Israel. And it appears that the man killed may have had an involvement, too. Before long, the man's associates learn of Deever's gambit with Sokolow and go after them to find out who was behind the killing. More lethally, the real murderer learns of what Deever said to Sokolow and believes Deever might actually know something. He goes after Deever. This is a tight, well constructed murder mystery with two first-rate components. First is the romance which builds between the characters played by Hurt and Weaver. These two people are attractive and smart. Hurt, in particular, comes across as guileless but he's no one's patsy. The two are very likable. Second, the situation which develops poses some ethical questions. Grades of gray come into play; it wouldn't be accurate to say that the murderer is simply another bad guy. The movie also features some first-rate actors besides Hurt and Weaver. There's Christopher Plummer who, as usual, brings so much assurance and nuance to his role; James Woods as the best friend, always a little off balance; Pamela Reed as Woods' sister; her mutual declaration of non-love with Hurt is very funny and appealing; Steven Hill and Morgan Freeman as the two cops assigned to the case; Kenneth McMillan as Hurt's father, angry and vulnerable; and Irene Worth and Albert Paulsen as Weaver's parents, people who love her but, especially the mother, always put responsibilities and obligations into the love. They all are very good. I like this movie a lot. The DVD picture looks fine. There are no extras to speak of"}

I'm with the genius crowd. Brothers Grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie I've seen in a long while. Gilliam's style is baroque, and by a director who knows the definition. Visually, this can be quite stunning, as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene. Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam's magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas. It's 1812, the Age of Napoleon, not a good time for the Imagination. Nevertheless, con-men Jake & Will Grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear, since it's also an Age of Anxiety, and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night. The bumbling Grimms are played, quite effectively by Matt Damon (who pulls off the accent nicely) and Heath Ledger (a head scratching, eye-squinting success). Their evil counterparts, End Products from the Age of Reason, are a French general, played by Jonathan Pryce, and his wacky henchman, played by the always wonderful Peter Stormare. Little girls are disappearing in a small town, and something needs to be done about it. And the Grimms are caught in the middle. You will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales, as the Grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery. To reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises. Check it out"}

I had heard conflicting views of the film- it's great, it's horrible, etc. After viewing it for myself, I must agree with those who gave it negative reviews. However, despite its lack-luster performance, the film did serve a purpose in the classroom. True, the film leaves something to be desired. They change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them. Editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story. Rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely. Major events in the rising action are left out, thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing. Overall, very few of my students liked the film adaptation of Jane Yolen's novel, which they found so riveting. On a brighter side, because of so many differences, viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through T-Charts and Venn diagrams. It also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills. After reading the novel and viewing the film, most of my students agreed that the book was much better- something a reading teacher loves to hear!"}

{"id": "dvd-positive-63", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "Okay...when I heard about The Brat Pack Movie and Music Collection I was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of The High School Reunion Collection which was released several years ago. Both sets were released by Universal. Fear not, I am here to tell you about the differences. The first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies. Like it's closest cousin The High School Reunion Collection, The Brat Pack Movie and Music Collection includes the exact same movies-\"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Sixteen Candles\" and Weird Science.\" The cover art on the DVD's is the same, no new bonus material with each film that I detected. It has been mentioned time and time again that the choice of movies is a bit off. No one even really pegged this acting group \"The Brat Pack,\" until around 1985. Molly Ringwald was one of the best known Brat Pack members and \"Sixteen Candles\" helped to start the whole Brat pack phenom but no one ever considered \"Weird Science\" a Brat Pack movie. Trust me, I remember the 80's. It always seemed like it would make more sense to include \"St Elmo's Fire\" or \"Pretty in Pink\" in with this set. This is painfully clear with the bonus music disc included. The music CD includes the following songs-\"True\" by Spandau Ballet, \"Tenderness\" by General Public, \"If You Leave\" by OMD, \"Weird Science,\" by Oingo Boingo, \"Oh Yeah\" by Yello (which was in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", Pretty in Pink by the Psychedelic Furs, \"Don't You Forget About Me,\" by Simple Minds and \"I Go Crazy\" by Flesh For Lulu. Why include music from \"Pretty In Pink\" and not include the movie? On to the packaging. The packaging is very unique and makes the set worth owning. I own over 100 TV on DVD and box sets and nothing is like this. The DVD's are held in what is literally a three ring binder and the DVD's are in sleeves instead of jewel cases. On the back page of the binder is a pop quiz. For the most part it is very similar to The Highschool Reunion collection but it's nice to have the bonus CD and the cool packaging. However, it would have been nice if Universal would have given fans who bought the previous set a little more inspiration to purchase this new collection. One must assume they must not own the rights to \"Pretty in Pink\" (it's listed as a Parmount DVD) because that is easily one of the best known Brat Pack movies and it seems insane that it is not included in a set with the term Brat Pack associated with it."}

Unlike some other bands, Incubus seems to perfectly display each musician's talents so well with each song, and this -for me- showed how it can all be put together so seamlessly. Every song is a highlight on this one - my favorites are Made for TV Movie and Sick Sad Little World.

{"id": "dvd-positive-647", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "I have no idea why I had never heard of this movie before because Ronin is a whale of a good film. I can take or leave most action films, but give me a taut, intelligent, suspenseful thriller filled with great action, wicked twists, and some of the best car-chasing footage you'll ever see, and I'm happy. Throw Jean Reno and the one and only Robert De Niro into the mix, as well, and I'm happier than any clam has a right to be. Director John Frankenheimer obviously knows that action alone doesn't make for a good action film, and he also knows that the only way to make a high speed chase scene look authentic is to film a real high speed chase scene. The title is derived from the term for masterless Samurai of feudal Japan - warriors who failed their master and were left to wander in the shame of their failure. In modern parlance (and in this movie), the term applies to special agents of various governments who find themselves quite on their own thanks to the end of the Cold War. These men still put their skills to good use by selling their services to those willing to pay them for handling sensitive, usually dirty, jobs. In this case, Sam (De Niro), Vincent (Reno), and three others are brought together in France by an Irish lass named Deirdre and charged with acquiring a metal case well-protected by its current carrier. It sounds easy - ambush the target and his security force, snatch the case, exchange it for cash, and move on. Naturally, the mission turns out to be extremely complicated, as a couple of powerful parties want whatever is in that case, and a certain individual proves less than trustworthy. What's the world coming to when you can't even trust a selfish, independent-minded, well-trained gun-for-hire? De Niro has to run over and shoot up half of France before everything gets resolved in this film. The only problem I had with this movie came in the form of the thick accents of some of the characters, especially the Irish ones - you may want to use closed captioning at times to really understand everything that is said. The actors themselves, though, were quite good, especially De Niro and Reno, who make a great team. As for the mix of bad guys, how about three - count 'em, three - former adversaries of James Bond (Michael Lonsdale, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Pryce)? Not only that, the script is worthy of all these fine actors. As I've mentioned already, though, the chase scenes are really the most memorable aspect of this film. Frankenheimer doesn't have any use for these fancy-schmancy new digital means for manufacturing this kind of action, instead treating the viewer to several good, old-fashioned thrill rides through the streets of Paris and its local environs. Besides filming an incredible number of scenes live, he also chose to forego the accompaniment of a musical score in these situations, letting the revving engines, squealing brakes, and numerous crashes and explosions present the action as authentically as possible. They had to have had an incredible number of stunt drivers and stunt men involved, as folks were constantly crashing or jumping out of the path of oncoming cars - not to mention the extended high speed chase down one-way streets into busy oncoming traffic. I'm telling you - these chase scenes are flat-out impressive. Obviously, I think Ronin has it all. Without De Niro, it still would have been a fantastic film; with him, it's a must-see in my book"}

{"id": "dvd-negative-28", "domain": "dvd", "label": 0, "text": "Even though I would agree that \"Erin Brockovich\" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in \"Pretty Woman.\" I am second to no one in enjoying a good \"David and Goliath\" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the \"true\" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones. However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the \"Xena\" character is the main attraction in \"Xena: Warrior Princess\" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character). Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in \"Pretty Woman\" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree). The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel. Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk. Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric. Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium. This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs. Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired \"work clothes\" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests. Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and weary attorney who is Erin's boss. The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters. Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience. The \"convenience\" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case. Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar \"bonus\" check (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a \"thanks\" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers. The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant. Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source. Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich. Is the movie entertaining-absolutely. Inspiring- not even slightly."}

{"id": "dvd-positive-995", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "Wrath Of The Dragon. INTRODUCTION: The Dragon Ball Z series is one of the finest animes out there, as any fan of Japanese animation will tell you. The series has a \"love it or hate it\" reputation, but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons. Young people love the series for the fast-paced action and adventure, while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters, and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time. It's no wonder the series is considered Akira Toriyama's magnum opus, and by far the best of the three Dragon Ball series. When Toei animation made Dragon Ball into an anime, they didn't copy Toriyama's mangas verbatim. They added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga, often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace. Toei even created movies based on the series! There were thirteen movies, two television specials, and one OVA/OAV. While not usually canon to the storyline, they are an undeniable part of the Dragon Ball Z franchise that can't be ignored. OVERVIEW: This is the thirteenth of the thirteen Dragon Ball Z movies. THE STORY: Majin Buu is beaten. Our heroes have won. Peace has returned. Yeah, right. Just as everyone has settled down, Gohan and Videl rescue an old suicidal man, and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the Dragon Balls. What they don't know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe. The Z Fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe. But are they strong enough? REVIEW OF STORY: This is one of my favorite Dragon Ball Z movies, due in no small part to the unique storyline, and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular. Granted, I wish Vegeta had a larger role, but no big complaints there. There is no other part of the Dragon Ball Z series that has a storyline anything like this. The interaction between Trunks and Tapion is excellent as well. And the ending? Let's just say it stands on a plane all its own. You won't want to miss it. OFFICIAL? This is a rare example of a Dragon Ball Z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline. Right after the defeat of Buu, this would fit into the actual series continuity. It didn't exist in the original manga so I consider it unofficial, but you be the judge. REVIEW OF DVD: All of FUNimation's Dragon Ball Z DVDs are pretty much the same as far as content goes. There is no bonus content, unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the DVD to be bonus material. And honestly, I could have lived without them. Some more recent DVDs have character profiles, though these are lacking and could have been written better. Why couldn't get get interviews with cast and crew, or trivia/facts, something like that? FUNimation has a lot of room to improve on the DVDs. THE DUBBED VERSION: Lots of people tend to bash FUNimation's dub of the Dragon Ball Z series? Why? It's inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid. They can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes, such as Full Metal Alchemist, but every time they've tried dubbing Toriyama's classic, they butcher it to hell. The nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series. Stick with the uncut subbed track. OVERALL: Get it. Dragon Ball Z movies don't get any better than this. EDITION NOTES: It was released in edited and uncut versions. Do I even have to say it? Get uncut. And watch the subtitled Japanese version."}

Edward G.Robinson is Gino Moretti, a self-made banking magnate who built his fortune as a ruthless moneylender who chose not to observe the usual niceities about observing normal banking regulations concerning records and collateral. In his over the top performance as an Italian who might have been Vito Coreleone had the Don chosen to go straight, Robinson is a totally self-centered egomaniac who comes off more as a smug Biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the old-world banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations. It is hard to like him as he rips into his four sons, insulting each of them in ways that undercut whatever sense of independence and goodness that otherwise might have been there. It is only Max (Richard Conte), who can see,if only belatedly, the vision of his father. And even Max learns that he must purge himself of the bitter dregs of poison and animosity that afflict his brothers. Max cannot do this alone; he requires the understanding first of Maria (Debra Paget) then later Helen (Susan Hayward), both of whom act as leavening agents that continually remind him of the goodness that each is sure lies within. Gino Moretti is truly a vicious inverted father figure in whose futile bleatings to his ungrateful sons,\"Who do you think I built this bank for?\" generates no pity in them but rather a sense of loss in us that he probably heard the same empty words from his father. The difference between the utter tragedy that this film was just a hairsbreath away from and the modest sense of optimism that it does end with is probably no more than what may, in similar real-life situations, have emerged. What goes around truly comes around, and HOUSE OF STRANGERS continually reminds us of the truism of that cliche"}

In my opinion, there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved, especially when considering the quality of the performances. The slight quiver in Weisz's voice was right on target as was Perez's accent. The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable. Considering the type of story and the setting, I can't help but think that a three-part mini-series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film.

It is said that in the violent late Middle Ages street shows were often staged in European cities where fake blood flowed like water, heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines during an evisceration delighting the crowd. It seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come full circle from Barbara Tuchman's gripping account of the awful fourteenth century. Despite the abundant gore if the film had been better handled it could have been quite good. There are glimpses of its failed potential at different points. For instance the scene towards the end where the prison governor's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct copy of an actual event at the Bastille during the days of the early French revolution. In sum, as a special kind of disgusting art form it is interesting, as entertainment though Natural Born Killers sucks. I admit some people will like it , no doubt the same crowd who would attend public executions if they were available for viewing"}

I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young children, because of the nudity."}

We're supposed to find the characters played by Robert Redford and Debra Winger to be amusing, their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious, and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying. The problem is that the movie is too dumb to be taken seriously, and thus too dumb to be funny. Briefly, the story takes place in New York. Robert Redford is an assistant District Attorney about to be promoted to be the DA. Debra Winger is a defense attorney, and Daryl Hannah is a young woman with emotional problems, and is Debra Winger's client. The plot involves a fire 20 years ago, when Daryl Hannah was eight, a fire that killed her artist father and purportedly destroyed a large number of his paintings. This experience left Daryl Hannah traumatized, but all is not as it seems, and now, 20 years later, Daryl Hannah is first accused of attempted theft and later of murder. Unfortunately, the plot involves many elements that simply don't make sense. I won't go into detail, but Roger Ebert does a good job of listing four different major things that make the plot completely unbelievable. As well as the story being dumb I found some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny to be anything but. For example, Robert Redford is a weekend father to a teenage daughter. At one point his ex-wife threatens to go to court to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Robert Redford makes a telephone call to his ex-wife's home and starts an angry monologue of threats about how he'll take her apart in court. Then he realizes that he's actually talking to his daughter! This mistake is apparently supposed to be hilarious. Ha, ha. In another scene Robert Redford and Debra Winger are together and see one of the bad guys. Robert Redford takes off on foot to try to catch him. Debra Winger, who doesn't know how to drive a car, feels it necessary for her to jump into Robert Redford's car and try to follow him. She makes a wrong turn and finds herself going the wrong way into traffic on a wide heavily trafficked street. There follows one minute of her frantically dodging cars at the last moment. Very funny. Ha, ha, ha. This movie could have been a fairly good romantic thriller if they had fixed the plot and not tried to be a comedy. But the dumb plot and the unfunny attempts at comedy make it a complete waste of time. Rennie Peterse"}

Then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before. Still, I went into the movie theater ready to give \"Home On The Range\" a chance... ...and fell asleep. I found the soundtrack uninspired and the story incredibly weak. I admit the animation is fine (but not spectacular) and some of the jokes are funny but they are very few and far between. Apparently \"Home On The Range\" was meant to be released before \"Brother Bear\" but because of story issues it was delayed. I don't think it should have been made in the first place. It has also ruined the work laid out by \"Brother Bear\" for a new Disney renaissance. I think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired, because not only is it terrible, but it ended mainstream 2-D animation for Disney, a massive loss to the entertainment industry. The DVD has an audio commentary (with rather overconfident directors if you ask me considering this movie is a disaster). There is also a behind the scenes featurette, games, art review and music video- more than this movie that never should have happened deserves."}

Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time. I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan. So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students? Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do? Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment? I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese. Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet. The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful. Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here. Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture. Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students. There would be nothing further from the truth. Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here. Not by a long shot. Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant. The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states."}

This 1986 instant classic of Rob Reiner's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film. The musical score is dramatic, it sets the tempo from start to finish, and it never misses a beat; each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie's unfolding, and you don't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding. The lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient, lazy summer days of grandeur, to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity. One can in Stand By Me favorably assume to watch: pie eating contests, leeches, trains, train dodging, mail ball, fancy cars, fancy footwork (i.e. Verno's beloved comb's freefall), cantenes (thought they disappeared w/ Ben Franklin's outlets), junkyard dog chases, and much much more. The ending is the real gravy. The narration is superb also. By far one of the favorite films of my youth. Believe John Cusack can be seen playing the role of Gordy's football star elder brother? Stand By Me is the childhood that big city life just doesn't afford, at least not anymore. Everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses; rustic destination spots, like the ones presented in this movie, are still out there folks. With a smidgen of ambition toward adventure, which will take your there, the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated. Although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors. Five stars for Reiners finest photoplay."}

The chemistry between the two leads is also lacking; Fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned, he's an inexpressive bloke, while Heather Graham is ALL TOO expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera. Besides, she's not even that attractive; even her co-star in this particular film, Natascha McElhone, blows her out of the water in that department. The ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker' candy in your mouth, sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour. It was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did, I have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly In spite of all that, Chen Kaige's direction is good, and he creates some suspenseful moments. So I give the film a generous \"** out of 5\" rating. But if you're a Heather Graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes; and for Joseph Fiennes fans you'll receive half naked perks."}
{"id": "dvd-positive-208", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "Brilliant is an often overworked phrase, but in the case of *Hamlet* starring Mel Gibson, the word cannot be used enough. For brevity's sake, I will save Zeffirelli's cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing. This review is for Chris Devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult Shakespeare script. Devore somehow makes it better. Were he in London, late 1500's, he would have been a collaborator, making Will's work the pearl it is today. My only plea is that, at some date, we will get to see Gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared. This may have been Glenn Close's best work. This is not a complaint, but rather a sign that anyting else she may have or has done cannot be any better than this wonderful, small role. Ophelia (Close) has an important commentary that must be heard in order for the play to work - Will was no fool - and it needs a Close to do it. Alan Bates has been a staple of English theatre and screen and has delivered many fine parts (such as Gabriel Oaks in *Far From the Madding Crowd*, 1967). As Claudius, the regicide and brother of Hamlet, Senior, Bates makes you believe that his reign could have been noble except for that one small cancer, that flaw in his character - very clintonian and very believable. I have wanted to kick Ian Holm's ever since Ash hurt Ripley in *Alien*, 1979. I have to keep reminding myself that he really is that believable and that I really don't hate him, It's the character he has created so well. His body of work is repleat with characters of such believability that you forget his name - IAN HOLM - until he does it again, the next time, in the next movie. If films were strictly Hasidic, Holm's version of Polonius would be Kosher. There is not one piece of ham in his entire performance. It is worth the purchase of the DVD just to see him act. Everyone is good in the movie and there is not time to talk about all of them. But a note to those whose noses are airbourne and won't tolerate anyone but Olivier as Hamlet. There are several uneven performances in his excellent movie. There are no uneven performances in this piece. Finally, we come to the mad prince of Denmark. It is most astonishing that I watched this epic again after Mel's dark night of the troll, thrashing about in complete insanity, arguably brought on by hard likker, frustration, and stupidity. Yet with all said, Gibson IS the essential Hamlet. You will find no other actor who delivers the goods the way the Cruiser from the Boozer does. You know this is true, not just by watching the exquisite performance on the DVD, but by Gibson's own marvelling at what was accomplished, not because of some actor's raison d'etre, but rather by the actor's very ability to understand that he is dealing with things that go beyond the ken of normal humans. IS Hamlet crazy, or crazy like a fox? And when is he crazy we get to hear Mel say in the devastating interview he made for the DVD release many years gone by. So, enough from me. If you want to see the best Hamlet ever, buy this DVD and feast. - Dick Anderso"}

The C.G animation which was produced by GONZO was poor and didn't blend in at all. (If you want good works by GONZO check out Full Metal Panic, Vandread, Hellsing, Gatekeepers and a few others). The plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12. 2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world. There they meet a strange man(strong silent type). Each episode goes something like this. The kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place. The bad guy(kid??) sends his minions to where they 3 are. The man in black shows up(approx 7 min left in ep) and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun(attached to arm)turns on and he says \"IT HAS MOVED??\" yells \"SOIL IS MY POWER\" (cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots ) a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy, then he goes away. The kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over. That happens every single episode and there is very little plot development. Come on at least Pokemon has more of a plot.

{"id": "dvd-negative-38", "domain": "dvd", "label": 0, "text": "Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done, my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun. The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha. For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making."}

Added to their performances are footage from many periods of Mr. Cohen's life, interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well.

At 72, Mr. Cohen may have lost a lot of his voice-- he opines that he never could carry a tune-- but he has lost none of his brilliant self-deprecating humor. The singers are fantastic; but why wouldn't they be with such words and lyrics? Nick Cave sings probably Cohen's most well-known song \"Suzanne,\" introduced to the U.

Anthony is great, of course; but the Wainwrights, both Martha (her rendition of \"The Traitor\" will put chills on your spine) and Rufus who sings \"Everybody Knows,\" \"Chelsea Hotel Number 2\" and \"Hallelujah\" are not to be missed.

Directed by Tamra Davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor, this movie is one of those you smile most of the time, and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot. Luke Wilson plays Jesse, a convict getting out of prison after a theft, and who is getting married to his sweetheart, Hope (Drew Barrymore). Along for the ride are his best friends (Dean Cain as a former Green Beret, who is gay; Mitchell Whitfield as the lawyer Saul, who was Wilson's lawyer; Andy Dick as the nerdy Teddy, who is in a bad marriage; and Sean Patrick Flannery, who plays Billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as Hamlet because he spouts off lines from the play when he robs the banks. Billy doesn't tell his buddies that he's planning on robbing a bank before the wedding, but one thing leads to another and all the men are holed up in the bank with the local sheriff (Fred Ward) who also happens to be Billy's father! Soon, the inevitably nasty FBI comes in, headed by the sadistic and cold agent, played with malevolent glee by the durable and dependable Raymond J. Barry (Dead Man Walking, The Chamber). The movie moves from some very humorous scenes to a devastating finale. This dramedy works because the performances are top notch and the script while manipulative is honest. Brad Dourif gives one of his best performances since \"Cuckoo's Nest\" as the mentally challenged Vietnam vet. Fred Ward, Dean Cain, Sean Patrick Flannery and Mitchell Whitfield are also excellent. It's the best work I've seen Cain do. The movie entertained me immensely, and I would recommend it to audiences who enjoy a dramatic comedy! Or is it a comic drama? Cheers"}

Here, the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby, clumsy, and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing.

They produce what is demanded from them; in turn, they receive awards. cultural industry empowers these demands; they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the Western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded. There is no single ME movie which depict the story of Western imperialism in the ME and then awarded for doing so. ME movies must show that ME women are in need of emancipation; ME cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized. civilization itself is presented in vertical sense; there is a civilization somewhere out there all MEasterners are expected to reach; yet, it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them. (no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country; who deprived them of education and knowledge. the West is represented by beautiful, blonde nurses, a nice American guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his \"everyday Western knowledge of medicine\" in the midst of total ignorance, and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs. such a nice way to civilize!) the story of Afghanistan is real. however, the movie does not render a fair job in reflecting the background of it. rather, it does an excellent job in meeting the cultural demand; in producing a product that can sell well. the situation is miserable; but what caused such misery in Afghanistan? your answer after seeing the movie will be that it is Islam; it is that Islamic culture; that backward culture of those people with wonderful eyes. such a conclusion is strongly demanded in the absence of other factors. there is no single implying in the movie, a smallest reference, that Afghanistan has suffered centuries old imperialism at the hands of the British and then the Russian and now Americans who played their Great Game on the chessboard of Eurasia. There is a passage in the movie to the effect that somebody will come to liberate them. those imperialists came in the name of civilization; French did to Algeria, the British did to India; all in the name of bringing them civilization. It was White Man's Burden to do so. Yet Makhmalbaf needs more awards. he has to compete in the cultural circus and perform well for the pleasure of Western audiences, in order to continue to be in demand. you did a nice job, applauses; go on.

It's not necessarily a pleasant read, but always an engrossing one. Emily Bronte's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you've finished the book. Modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters' works into film and this is no exception. The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book. Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today, but this movie is a definite low point for both. As Heathcliff and Catherine, Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland. Binoche's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves. Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role. The other characters are likewise lacking in realism, only Janet McTeer fares well, she is fabulous as Ellen Dean. Even if the acting were better, the story does not capture the essence of the book. Everything moves too quickly, the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words. Sinead O'Conner's appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary. This film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it. The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part, ugly and unflattering. Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests!

As I mention above, something very unusual about the film effects me in a way I can't explain. First of all, the entire film is very effectively well-done the way everything is dark and damp and, for lack of better words, SCARY!

The mirror on the wall, and the location of the ladder are two things I could have SWORN I've seen somewhere before, like a childhood memory I can't figure out.

With the \"mean rival\" changed to \"nice rival\", and add \"with hard work\" after \"dreams come true\". I mean, look at Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what did they do to make their dreams come true, which is a pathetic one, to marry a prince? One had a 100-year beauty sleep and the other had a fairy-godmother to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand! Casey Carlyle was totally different. I agree with people, that it's impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time, which is one of the reasons I give this film a 4 and not a 5. But it's an improvement. The cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done, and while people on IMDB say that they're to showy, it is true, but aww, come on, this is a movie, not a real competition, and everybody likes some nice ice-skating in movies. The acting is great, especially Michelle Trachtenberg and Hayden Panettiere. Michelle's acting is really good, and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements. Hayden Panettiere's acting is also good, but it's a pity that her character is somewhat bland and \"Mary-Sue\"ish. \"Mary-Sue\"ish would mean that she's almost perfect.

{"id": "dvd-positive-149", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "RESPIRO is one of those Italian treasures of a film, this time written and directed by the insightful Emanuele Crialese, that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story. RESPIRO mixes the gut-level Italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by Fellini. Lampedusa is a Mediterranean island between Sicily and Tunisia that is baked by the sun and is far enough away form the culture of Italy to be a return to the native. The population is all involved in fishing. On this picturesque island lives Grazia (the beautiful and talented Valeria Golina) who appears to be a wonderfully free spirit but is actually a bipolar personality. She lives happily with her fisherman husband Pietro and her children: teenage Marinella (Veronica D'Agostini), Pasquale (Frncesco Casisa - a very fine little actor!) and Filippo (Filippo Pucillo). The boys adore their mother and their father and often make excuses for their mother's wild behavior patterns to the villagers who view her as a menace. When Grazia's actions come under scrutiny by Pietro and he considers the advice of the grandmother (Muzzi Loffredo) who occasionally gives Grazia tranquilizing injections when her manic side surfaces and suggests Grazia needs psychiatric help in Milan, Grazia runs away to hide in a grotto, her whereabouts are known only to Pasquale. The little village mentality merges and the people search the waters for what they feel must be the death of Grazia, only to discover on St Bartolo's Day that Grazia is blithely swimming in the ocean. How this affects the village and the lives of this tender family is the secret of the movie: revealing the ending would dissipate the joy of RESPIRO. Suffice it to say that the closing footage will simply take your breath away! This little treasure of a movie has some of the most imaginative photography - both above and below the surface of the surrounding ocean - of any film you'll see. The music by John Surman is pitch perfect and atmospheric. The way director Crialese captures the folklore-like behavior of the youngsters' games, and the married-to-the-sea philosophy of the villagers, is utterly magical. This is a movie that celebrates those raw emotions of being human that seem to be eroding into the cultural pablum of contemporary society. RESPIRO is a glowing reminder of the worth of a return to Eden. In Italian with English subtitles. Grady Harp, November 200"}

He plays Pally, 35-year-old Boston cop who is forced to retire because of the heart problem, and his acting is very good. Overall, however, there is not much that I can recommend in `Dead Heat' except some nice touch in showing the characters. The film tries to include as many things as possible, but few of them really materialize. The story looks rather like a familiar one. Because of his early retirement, Pally starts to drink, and even thinks of committing suicide. His relationship with his estranged wife Charlotte (Rhada Mitchell) is not going well and he is not happy to know that she is now going out with someone else. But Charlotte is also nice and caring, so she persuades Pally's brother Ray (Anthony LaPaglia) to visit him. Ray, who is accused of not being a law-abiding citizen by his too earnest brother, has a good plan to make money easily, and offers it to Pally. It is about buying a racehorse cheap, he says, and it is an easy job because he happens to know that the horse, which has not win any races recently, is actually misdiagnosed, only suffering from a polyp a small operation can remove. When everything is going well, things get suddenly complicated because of a gambling-addicted jockey Tony (Lothaire Bluteau). From here, the story snowballs into blackmail, caper and even murder, but the film's overall tone is always light, not taking itself very seriously. Unfortunately, for all their effective acting from Sutherland, LaPaglia, Mitchell, and Bluteau, the weak and unsure direction totally fails to give momentum to the otherwise unremarkable film. It is not funny when it tries to make us funny, and it is not romantic when it tries to be romantic. Feeble direction simply misses several good opportunities to make good use of the jockey's sullen little daughter Sam (Kay Panabaker, her feature debut), who could have been a little surprise (or gem) in this unconvincing plot. It is true that Kiefer Sutherland shows in `Dead Heat' another side of acting talent, which is less eccentric and intense than most of the roles he had played, or he would play. That is good news, and the only good news here"}

They have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age! What other band sounds better 30 years later? After my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly. Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out. And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there's a great build up to the climax of each song. However, what's really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song. NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY. It's like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show. The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc. The closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs. That's exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show. Bonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety. Perhaps someday we'll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD. Update 6/14/05: Exactly a year later, I've still yet to pop this into my DVD player for a second watch, and Cheap Trick's still my favorite band."}

I had seen The Long, Long Trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies I have ever seen; one of those films where you can't believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do. We enjoy most of the I Love Lucy series, but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows; the aggrivating ones, and this film was just an overly long aggrivating I Love Lucy episode. There is funny humor and aggrivating \"humor\" and this was definitely the 2nd type. Yes, it was interesting to see Lucy and Desi doing films together, but overall these films are just tolerable, and none are ones I would rewatch for enjoyment. Too Many Girls was definitely a B picture, really really bad in so many ways...poorly written script, cheap scenery; you never got the feeling they were in college, except at the football game, which seemed so similar to the football game the Marx Brothers participated in in Horse Feathers! Too much partying, singing, dancing; what was this school majoring in, theatre and opera? It just is a really bad picture. Yes, neat to see Lucy and Desi and how they met, and see them so young together, but otherwise, a real time waster in my mind. The funniest thing on this disc was the cartoon extra! Of the three, Forever, Darling is probably the best but again that seemed \"lacking\" somewhere. The color was that beautiful almost surreal 50's color that I like. The Yosemite scenery was beautiful too. But I think the angel stuff could have been much better developed; he was out of the scene too long at times. The part I liked best was Lucy imagining herself in the movie with James Mason because it was quite funny. But the camping trip was just a very predictable mishap time that was too much in the I Love Lucy mold and I was bored with it quickly. I know die hard fans of Lucy and Desi will buy this no matter what, and that's fine. But for others, I advise you see them first...you may like them, but then you may see them for what they really are cinematically. There are lots better movies out there that I would rather buy!

But this was actually one of the better films. It had a lot wrong with it, but it had enough good to make it enjoyable. Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne, takes power as the young prince Talon (lee Horsley) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant. Pretty standard stuff. But it's exectuted well. The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard's Conan Story \"The Hour of the Dragon\" as Cromwell and his conspirators, including a witch, find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful, ancient sorcerer. In the Conan story the sorcerer's name was Zaltotun. In this movie, the name is Xusia. Mere coincidence? I think not. But Xusia is played well be the towering Richard Moll (of Night Court fame). He's suitably imposing and evil, as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life. Unfortunately Xusia doesn't get enough screen time. Lynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here, too. Horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by Errol Flynn in Robin Hood than by Conan. He's a fun-loving reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne. He is eventually captured and Cromwell has him nailed to a cross, although it's an \"X\" cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism. Again, this is a scene lifted from a Conan story \"A Witch Shall be Born\" when Conan was nailed to a cross. Only Conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while Talon, actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately. Now, I'm no doctor but I'm guessing that someone who had a 4\" nail driven through their palms is NOT going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but, ok, it's fantasy so I'll buy it. Still, despite some shortcomings, this is an enjoyable little diversion. The ending Credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized"}

The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes). Sure, the film isn't PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn't have to be PC. But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film. These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic. Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences. And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there. No CGI in those days. This is one of the reasons they work so well. CGI looks fake anyway. It makes movies seem like cartoons. People know it isn't real. CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes. Check this film out.

Since Vanilla Ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie, the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new. I went to high school with kids like this and I've bought the Eminem CD. And there's a little more to them than the stupidity. But let's discuss the movie. Anne Hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in East L.A. (??). Seeing her boyfriend beat down, she's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating. Then she goes to parties, gets into even more trouble and starts losing her Jerry Springer-inspired ghetto talk. The Mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner, but well he's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner. Actually, he's coming off like a gangsta Yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat. Yes, it's ironic that she's trying to dress ghetto while he's trying (not very hard) to dress suburban (wife beater is suburban?) The movie's climax is a scene in which Anne and Bijou ask the guys if they can join their \"crew\" and if the gang didn't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked, they sure have it then (and really, who doesn't know that that's gang initiation standard - started by the Hell's Angels in 1965). After that disaster (both Anne and Bijous say no - but Bijou takes a little more time saying no) the movie unravels as Anne Hathaway discovers her inner WHITE GIRL and her friends act even more stupid. There's a neat scene between her and Bijou Philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people, but it's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie. The one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate DJ Squalls' character from Hustle & Flow (and Hustle & Flow in and of itself) since that's a white character in a black world that doesn't fall into either extreme of wigger or Doogie Howser. He's just himself whereever he goes. He's someone the morons of this movie could learn from (but really wouldn't you rather just see them all shot dead?"}

Respiro's locale is Lampedusa, a tiny island far off the west coast of Sicily. About the same latitude as Malta, this place is about as remote as it gets - Tunisia is closer than Palermo. It can be safe to say that Italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades; this is Italy of de Sica and Mascagni, not Fellini and Prada. The men go out to sea, the children play, women pack fish, old black-clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky. Throughout this film you would probably ask yourself, \"Is she really as crazy as the family and neighbors think she is or just free spirited?\" It's a fairly typical story, the type that a few great (and many, many average) Italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations - life in the sun drenched rural, ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds. How long since \"Cinema Paradiso?\" What I like most about the movie, besides the appealing scenery, was the interrelations of the characters, the humor, petty gossips, the impromptu emotional outbursts, the displays of maternal and filial affection. The two boys are tremendous: the older Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) is the more mature of the two. The younger Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings, often without sense. His rant against the busybody women is a treasure, as is his little-brother-as-big-brother protectiveness of his sister from the policeman-friend. The boy embodies an epic Italianate inflammability far beyond his years. While viewing this I thought the son's affection was overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times. They do spend a lot of time and energy comforting their mom plus defending her against verbal attacks in the village. After seeing this film, I have realized that the rural lives by the sea in many countries are similar, the differences are in the languages, but the feelings are same.

First of all i loved that it really didn't have anything to do with the first, aside from Cassidy being Katherine's cousin,and sharing the same last name (there is only one reference to Katherine and Sebastian in the beginning). It is much better than having different actors playing old characters, which drags a movie down alot. I thought the story was great, with good twists.The whole cast is very attractive, which can't hurt either. The \"bad\" characters are all pretty likeable, aside from one, and all is well in the end. The best thing about this movie is the character Cassidy. I sarted out hating her, and ended up really liking her for her realness, and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a b*tch.

{"id": "electronics-negative-957", "domain": "electronics", "label": 0, "text": "First - a disclaimer: I know very little about telephone headsets, but decided to buy one because I had a series of long telephone meetings coming up. I walked to my local Staples store, expecting to find a variety of prices and products - and thinking that I'd pay perhaps $30 to $50 at the low end of the market. At the store, I found that only the computer-based headsets were that cheap - and the only model that worked on a real, old-fashioned land line was the Plantronics S11 on display (it was priced at $130 Canadian). Since work was paying for it, I didn't mind spending the extra money, but expected that, at that price, the quality and ease of use would be quite high. When I brough it back to the office and installed it, I found that: - The regular handset and the headset cannot be plugged in at the same time. That means that every time I want to use the headset, I need to fumble around at the back of the unit to switch wires. - The volume of both ingoing and outgoing conversation is very low - even when I turn up the volume controls to max. The people I spoke with complained enough that I switched back to my regular handset. - The microphone, although it's somewhat adjustable, is short and inflexible enough that I can't get it very close enough to my mouth. When I try to move it closer, the earpiece turns and slips off my ear. - The headset itself - that is, the plastic, adjustable arch and rubber pad opposite the speaker - is very awkward and prone to slipping off my head. It might have been better to design it like a regular two-sided earphone unit - so that it would be more balanced and stay secure. I don't know whether these comments apply only to the S11 or to most headsets for traditional phones in general. Overall, however, if I'd been buying the S11 with my own money, I would likely have returned it and just gone back to using the regular phone handset"}

Easily enough, as it turns out. I was unable to load it and control the play lists. Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop. Dragging a folder to the device was pointless. Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place. I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from \"My Computer\" on the host system. After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out. I have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method. This was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb. Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!. Using Media Player to sync did no better. Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop. A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on. After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit. The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job. This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons. Throughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it. I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well. As it stands, it's without merit as a player."}

You're given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical), which is all you really need. Movies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind, in front, and to your left and right when you're connected via optical. Take note that DTS also sounds 'boomier' and a tad crisper than Dolby D does, especially in Gladiator. Honestly, I've nothing to complain about.

Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things.

Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc. It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one. One of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section. I record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station's tape deck to my iRiver. For those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it's a little trickier. You have to set the record input before -- you can't change it on the fly. I've recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on. Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show. Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show. I've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results. A bit of trial and error which I'm still refining with later iRiver products. The single AA batter lasts a good long time. Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low. If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved! The negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive. Files are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer. I don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file. But you can't trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don't think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another. Also, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way. I've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes. I'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button. After so many presses, it's starting to wear out. But it's still working reliably. I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention. I have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great. I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it. Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.

With the \"shift\" profile function, you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like X-Wing Alliance, completely keyboard free, using only the gamepad. Only downside: The D-pad is hard to control precisely. It's difficult to press only Up, Down, Left or Right. You almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead.

{"id": "electronics-negative-328", "domain": "electronics", "label": 0, "text": "I purchased this for my Intel iMac mainly because I was so frustrated with the Mighty Mouse. I wanted something with two separate buttons. I had tried the Logitech MX 610 (which I purchased as well for another computer) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful. So, I purchased this desktop set because I wanted it to match my Mac and so I could have a proper 2 button mouse. I figured the Mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well. In fact, I thought I would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a Mac and had extra shortcut buttons. Other than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse, this keyboard/mouse combo has been an utter disappointment. First of all, the white doesn't quite match. It's close, but just a touch too cream. Also, there's just too much silver. Especially on the mouse. Secondly, it doesn't have all the buttons the Mighty Mouse does. There is no button to switch to the Widgets. Luckily, you can press F12 on the keyboard. Not quite as convenient, but still possible. However, I have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs. This is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open. Thirdly, this mouse just doesn't work as well as other Logitechs. It is too light, lacking the \"feel\" and a bit of the comforting weight that the MX 610 has when you move it around. Also, the speed of the cursor is off. No matter how I try to adjust the speed, it doesn't quite match the speed of the original Mighty Mouse. It is either too fast or too slow. I think part of it is simply OSX's lack of adjustability compared to [gasp] Windows for cursor speed. Finally, the keyboard is simply atrocious. I don't even use it anymore. It's packed up in the box and I plugged the original Mac keyboard back in. The keys make a horrendous clatter when typing. The pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal. Also, the depth is quite shallow. This is a desktop keyboard. You can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards I've tried. Also, the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform. The raised dots to help you find the F or J buttons is too shallow. I can't find the asdf an jkl; rows by touch. I have to look. As a touch typist, this is an unforgiveable sin. It basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it. I'm typing on a Thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this Logitech. So, in short, save your money and avoid this keyboard/mouse combo. I rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons, unlike the Mighty Mouse, which is why I purchased this in the first place. It hit my most basic requirement. Otherwise, it really deserves a 1 star rating"}

I live in Los Angeles. I got this little Roady XT for me, and the XM2GO radio receiver for my wife. I was excited about getting these new satellite receivers in our cars. The Idea of having all these \"no ads\" radio stations playing through my car's FM frequency seemed cool. Setting up the unit and getting it to work was easy. Changing FM frequencies for the wireless transmitter is easy as well. It really is a neat little receiver. However, after setting up this unit in my car and the XM2GO in my wife's car, I was really disappointed in the music sound quality. The music sounds flat and with a hissy quality, almost monaural at times, and the volume seems a lot lower than the car's radio at the same volume setting. I had to turn the volume dial up quite a bit when playing satellite radio. The car's regular radio sounds much better than satellite radio if using wireless reception with any of the radio receivers, IMO. Besides, there are plenty of annoying ads and interruptions on XM radio as someone mentioned in another review. I thought about having the units professionally installed so that my wife and I wouldn't have to use the poor sounding wireless FM technology, but realized that both family cars have very expensive navigation systems and I didn't want the vehicle's factory warranty voided if some installer got inside our car's dash and accidentally messed something up. So about two month's ago, after several months of off-and-on use of XM radio service, I called to cancel my subscriptions. I had paid for a six month subscription for both receivers when I joined. As I expected would happen, when I called them to cancel, I was on the phone for allloooooonnnng time waiting for a customer service rep. Finally, I got to tell the rep all my relevant account information so I could cancel the service only to be put on hold and transferred to their \"special\" customer service department for cancellations where I was \"accidentally\" disconnected and had to call back and start all over again. Finally, after another long call to them, I was able to cancel my service.....or, so I thought. Yesterday, I was looking at my September credit card bill and saw that XM radio had charged my credit card for the next six months despite the fact that they assured me that my two accounts would be closed. I called my bank and had them reverse the charges and I may have the bank issue me a new credit card with different numbers in case XM tries to charge me again six months from now."}

Earbuds and over ear headphones don't block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music. I received these Philips HN110 headphones as a gift. When I first got these I was pretty disappointed at how flimsy they appeared. I have some KOSS over ear head phones which are nice and beefy. These are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space. They use a single AAA batt. Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through. I'm not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies. Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through. The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off. My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there (or it runs through the headphone band). I realize I like this single cord feature very much. Again these Philips HN 110 don't have this. I also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified. After about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside. Now I can't open the battery compartment without doing some damage to these headphones. I checked Philips website for info on these phones but I couldn't find any. I called their customer support and they told me I had to call a different #. I called the different number and got the Return Merchandise Authorization # but was told I need to send the receipt in. I got them as a gift so I don't have the receipt. In summary, their noise cancelling ability is pretty week. Better than my hefty non-noise cancelling KOSS over ears or my stethascope like Sony ear buds but only by about 10% or so (just to put a number in their). Flimsy design. Cords from both earphones. Hear the wind amplified. Battery compartment latch broke after a month and a half and their warrenty sucks"}

But here are my 2 cents: I got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago. The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years. I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better. They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them). The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound. I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that). I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass. They appear to have the right amount. (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound). I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).

Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent. I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed. Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before! It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs. The controls are also simple to use, both on the cord and on the PC. Audio recording quality is great as well. I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it. Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side, however. Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock. My biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department. I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones. Usually, I wear high-quality buds. So, perhaps I just have to get used to it. However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones. Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes. So, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165. They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort? Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me. UPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference. The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s. Also, the comfort is much better. They don't pinch my ears like the 155s. The cord going to the headset is also thicker, which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage. If you're thinking of the 155s, I would get the 165s instead"}

I called Netgear, waited on hold for 15 minutes, and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good. I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it. He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server. I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server (perhaps there are some), but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration. I went around and around with this fellow, then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold, another guy came on the line, who was pretty fluent in English. He explained his understanding of the situation, which was still wrong, and I explained the whole thing again to him. He had me turn the computer on and off, which of course I had already done several times, and check the monitor connection. After this analysis, he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it, and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly, that, coincidently, occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation, and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would, and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY, (emphasis his) that his software could have caused these symptoms. Since I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone, I suggested that I could take it to a local technician, and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system.

He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere). When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true. One speaker instead of five? Wall-mounted? Doesn't take up any floor space? We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves. One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment. The other, on the salesroom floor. In both set-ups it performed consistantly. In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement. So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer. Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools. The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television. Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer. My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound. More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning. Overall, we both got what we wanted. Expert sound designation and sleek, minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space)."}

It has terrific potential, if it worked. You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip. It's amazing. But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints. But I tried a local test first. I used roads as waypoints, main roads. This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes. I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database. I set up a local route, and started to follow it. It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem. But it would not go past the first waypoint. I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!. I did. Then it said take another u turn. It had me going in circles. Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would. The manual was no help. Support was no help. So it went back. I have ordered a Garmin i2. Hope this is ok. I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330.

I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips! I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!"}

{"id": "electronics-positive-645", "domain": "electronics", "label": 1, "text": "I hadn't seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod). The holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It's very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me. The part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version, so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups. The only \"bad\" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok. I like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you're willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway. Edit: I bought it for $20, but now it's $15. One more good reason to get this one. I'm not too sure, but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do, I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this, so don't buy this for your 5G iPod unless you're already sure or can try it before you buy it"}

My wife just ran the vacuum and I barely heard it. The earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable; however my other ones (Sony earbuds) sound better.

The first one I ordered I had to return becuase it would only play every other song, and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and I would have to take out the battery to make it stop. So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space. I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days. Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems.

Why should I have to activate my maps if I have paid for the product? Good question, well, I activated these maps on one PDA, and within 2 weeks my PDA died and I had to obtain warranty service. Well, I decided that I would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when I got it back from the manufacturers (I tend to switch my PDA every 3-4 months anyway). So I installed the maps on the new device and it asked me to activate. OK, I figure...no problem, I will be able to activate it 1...2...3 because after all, only I have the activation card/code. No such luck, TomTom wants PROOF that I have brought a new device? what kind of nonsense is that? What if I lost my PDA in 2-3 months? What if I'm a nut who likes to change PDA's every 3-4 months? What, you mean I have to show you proof that I switched? Isn't the fact that I have the activation card proof enough? I don't know too many people who pay $269 for a product and let other people use the activation codes. Avoid them at all costs. You will regret your purchase if you change devices frequently.

I never realized how bad the wireless was on this router until this week - dropped connetion 3 times in 15 minutes today alone, while reading the Amazon.com reviews. My desktop PC's graphics card went down this past week and I had to RMA it... so about 10 days to send out and get a return. I have always used a wired connection for my home desktops. The wireless access was a 'it's there if I need it' novelty. I started brining my IBM R51 laptop home from work so I could get online, VPN into work, etc.. This is the first time I have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so. The last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least. I logged on my first day and lost connection 5-6 times browsing MSN and Yahoo. At first I thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11. I went ahead and disabled the 108G feature since I had never come close to hitting that speed anyways, and changed the channel.. I used the IBM ThinkVantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used. I changed channels and I verified my signal strength before and after I changed, 95% signal strength. The connection is still getting dropped randomly. Changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength. No difference. Scanned the networks again using the IBM ThinkVantage software.. theres my router, 97% signal strength @ 54Mbs. unplugged router, modem, repaired my WINSOCKS with WinsockXP, rebooted PC. I turned on my modem first until is was ready to go, then the router until it was ready, and then my PC (as per the netgear website)and yea, no difference in the connections stability. The conection is still getting dropped randomly. I might expect this from a router thats on all the time and is getting tired from constantly being hammered. But I hardly ever used the wireless access (yes, wireless radio has been OFF). After reading these reviews, I am pretty sure the problem wont go away. The part that upsets me the most, I payed premium money for a product that I thought was premium. If this had been priced (at the time) at bargain bin prices, I wouldn't of cared.. but it wasn't and i do. The 'you get what you pay for' saying does not hold true for this product. Buyer Beware"}

Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews. It's great. The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply. The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own. Many people comment on the bass issue. For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion. True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website). I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience. The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit. Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not. There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also). By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew. Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto."}

{"id": "electronics-positive-560", "domain": "electronics", "label": 1, "text": "I did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse. I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable. At home, I use a Wacom tablet. Next month I am traveling abroad, so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington. Wireless was key for portability. I also wanted something rechargeable, and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out. I received it today, and I'm on my first charge. So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway). - I have large but skinny hands. Mouse is small, but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers. Of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse, but if you want portability, this is about the right size. - I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4). Excellent Bluetooth connection. Also very good response, very little delay. Only reservation is for the scroll wheel, which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands, because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position. It is hard to explain, but not a big issue for me. - USB charger works well. The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat, but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse) - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse. - As mentioned by others, installing the batteries is a challenge. Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers. Once I figured it out, not so hard. Overall, I don't seek perfection anyway, so this mouse does the job adequately for me. I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before, so I'm more or less in awe"}

It spins much faster than those 'crank' spinners or the 'push down' type -and faster spinning means more water off your veggies. As for the new features, here are my top five: 1) The lid is clear, so you can see the veggies spinning around in there and make sure you're not overfilling the spinner, the lettuce isnt bunching up in one corner, etc. OK, it's also just mesmerizing to watch your food spin round and round. Kind of like watching your clothes roll around in the dryer. 2) There is a brake! So after you've whipped your veggies into a frenzy, you can slam them to a stop -which also helps get more water off. This works better on the small sized spinner, since there is less weight to stop, but even on the big spinner it works very well. I have seen a brake on another spinner, but this one works much better. 3) The cord pulls itself back in -and gently: I disliked how the old 'string' spinners would yank on your arm, and if you didn't respond just right the string wouldn't pull in at all: it ends up just sitting there in a pile. You'd have to take the lid off and wind it up yourself! This new design winds the cord up every time. 4) The basket is smooth on the inside -that's something I defintely have not seen before. It's a subtle feature, but very helpful: it helps make sure little bits of your lettuce dont get stuck in the basket when you're cleaning it out. 5) You can stack things on top of it, both in the fridge and in the cupboard, because the top is mostly flat. The handle even sits in its own little pocket in the lid so that it's not in the way. In my house fridge space is valuable and I appreciate being able to stack this spinner like I do with my tupperware. So, overall I am impressed with this spinner (so impressed that I've also given it as a gift!). It does its job very well and has thoughtful extra features which make it more helpful around the kitchen"}

It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn't work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom.

{"id": "kitchen_&_housewares-negative-130", "domain": "kitchen_&_housewares", "label": 0, "text": "This blender is frustrating. It offers good points, but in the end, the flaws outweigh the benefits. First the good: The heavy glass base is stable and easy to clean. The powerful motor hacks through most foods with ease. When the blender is started, the motor begins at a low speed for a second or two before turning on fully. The problems I found led me to toss the blender. If you plan on making blended soups, beware of the explosive force with which this beast turns on. Without a heavy hand on the lid, both the lid and your soup will hit the ceiling. Moderately thick, viscous liquids (a lemon cream was the latest such one I experienced) tend to get caught in the scalloped swoops in the jar. This leads to only the center portion of the liquid being actively blended, while the outer edges stagnate and remain clumpy. Deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area. The above problems were annoying, caused occasional swearing, but were tolerable. What finally got me shopping for a replacement was worse. After several years of moderate use, the KitchenAid stopped working. The blades and motor are connected via a set of rubber teeth. These reduce operating noise, but over time, weaken. The problem first arose when making smoothies with chunky frozen fruit such as strawberries. A burning rubber smell came from the blender coupled with a strange noise and no action in the container. The rubber drive teeth slipped, and friction quickly heated them up. The result was hot, floppy rubber teeth that bent flat instead of turning the blades. When this happens, it takes 20 minutes or more before the teeth are capable of another round of use. Before long the blender could not even swirl water for more than a few seconds before the teeth slipped"}

It shipped quickly, with no damage (the box was pretty tattered, but the packing material and the actual dishwasher were fine). It's large for a countertop device, certainly bigger than most microwaves. Be sure to measure your available space, especially clearance to any cabinets above your installation site. I hit some minor bumps getting it installed. The dishwasher hose nozzle is supposed to connect to your kitchen faucet using a threaded quick-connect coupler included in the box. The coupler is supposed to screw onto the end of the faucet, but the faucet on that sink was a removeable spray handle on a long hose. There's no way for the included adapter to hook up to this, so I wound up having to install a new faucet (this isn't as bad as it sounds, as we were planning to replace the old one anyway). I brought the quick connect adapter to the hardware store with me to be sure it would fit the threads on the new faucet. Everything seemed okay in the store, but when I got home and installed the new faucet, I had some trouble. It turns out that the included adapter isn't particularly good quality, and didn't fit the faucet threads tightly enough to stay in place once the water pressure was actually turned on. I blew the hose nozzle off the end of the new faucet a couple of times until I finally went back to the hardware store and picked up an off-the-shelf adapter. Fortunately, it looks like Danby is using all standard-sized parts, so I was able to replace the flaky adapter with a new one that works well for only a couple of dollars. Once I had the thing up and running, it was easy to load and use. The basket is built to hold four full place settings, but I find that with some creative jiggering I can get it to take in any odd collection of dishes, mugs, baby cups, storage containers and what have you. The basket insert is removeable, converting it to an all-glasses tray, which we found useful for party cleanup. The machine really heats the water, so dishes come out clean. Even sticky stuff like melted cheese usually cleans right up. I've never had to use the heat-boost \"sanitize\" setting. It uses a very small amount of dishwasher soap and rinse fluid, and you want to be careful NOT to add too much. I made the mistake of overfilling the soap holder (spilled a little too much, figured it would just rinse out, oops) and wound up flooding my countertop in suds. This has only happened once and there was no damage. Call it a learning experience. I saw in some of the other reviews that the timer knob occasionally won't advance when you start running the machine, and this did happen to me once as well after I'd had it for about two weeks. It hasn't recurred since then, either becuase I've been particularly careful to set the timer in the right start position, or the timer's \"wearing in.\" Been using it steadily several times a week for a few months now, and after the initial hiccups, it's been working fine. No complaints, and now I'm looking for a Danby under-counter mini-refigerator to replace one in the same rec room.

We met him at a health fair, tried vegetable juices (including wheatgrass juice) and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet. I mean, how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day? Not so much. The Omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 RPMs, a powerful, slow auger that doesn't heat up the food or cause the juice to foam. This protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation. In addition, it is \"multifunctional\"--the juicer can also be employed to make baby food, meat pate, nut butter, or fine ground coffee. The machine is durable, said to be quiet, and has a 10-year guarantee. Sounds good, so we plunked down the cash and got the Omega juicer and set to work. So, how is it to USE the Omega? Well, it's EASY to put together, though there are quite a few parts and choices to make. Essentially, the steps are: 1. Install the screw drive--the big green plastic spiral, into the plastic housing. 2. Pop a juicing cone (a type of sieve) over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw. This takes a bit of jockeying, but it drops in just fine. 3. Screw on the end cap and nozzle. 4. Mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor. 5. Add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing. 6. Put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing; one for the pulp, one for the juice. Now it's ready to start juicing. 1. Cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube. This means if you juice carrots, those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise. 2. Turn on the motor: it has a forward direction to drive the food OUT, and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog. I've never needed to do this. 3. Push down the vegetables or other foods with the plunger which is included with the juicer. The food feeds along the screw, is broken up, and the juice is forced through the sieve (cone.) Out the nozzle comes the pulp. The juice flows out underneath, nearer to the motor. 4. When you are finished, turn off the motor, which is QUITE quiet--nothing like a blender or vacuum cleaner. More like the sound of a pasta maker or food processor, for comparison. Dismantle the machine and wash the parts. A big bottle brush is included for this, very helpful. 5. Cleanup takes about 2-3 minutes and is mainly rinsing. The worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that doesn't take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it. I do this ASAP, as I sip my juice, because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean. I then reassemble it right then and there, and it's ready to go again. The Omega juices kale, which is a rather tough leafy dark green form of cabbage. We now can do wheatgrass, once we grow some or find a source of flats of it. Just for grins, I tried the blank cone and did some meat grinding. It makes a fine grind--not something you'd use for hamburger. It would work for soft, somewhat grainy baby food or pate. I did not try making pasta. How does it compare to spinning cup type models, like the Braun which we previously used for juicing? 1. The spinning cup model (Braun) is LOUD, really loud. This is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result. This is typical for the cup-type juicer. Sounds like a blender. 2. The cup model cannot juice wheatgrass--the tender stalks of growing wheat or barley that have a lot of antioxidants. It also can't do tough leafy vegetables such as kale. 3. The cup model definitely does not extract as much juice from the vegetables and fruits as compared to the Omega. The pulp in the cup model is a wet slurry. The pulp from the Omega, by contrast, is like slightly moistened sawdust--definitely drier. In summary, the Omega juicer, while pricier than the typical spinning cup models, is quiet and effective. It gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup can't handle, like wheatgrass and if you want, meat. It extracts more juice--and at the prices for produce these days, especially if you buy organic produce, this is an important benefit. The juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use. If you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods, I would say, this is a model to strongly consider over others. The performance and added functionality well repay the higher price"}

The knife is sharp out of the box, reasonably well balanced, and has pretty good fit/finish. For the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless/skinless chicken, etc., that are largely prepared, this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work. The real drawback is the length. When you live in the South, you see vidalia onions that are 7\" in diameter. This knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies. And don't even think about getting it near hard melons or bone-in meats. Since I got this knife, I've expanded my collection quite a bit, even adding some real Japanese steel. But this little blade keeps a spot on my magnetic strip, where it comes out for small tasks or when my wife can't get me to relinquish the big blade. For most cooks, who need a real omni-tasker knife, I would look for a 9-10\" chef's knife rather than this."}

The food didn't burn, but I had to cook it a long time to get the chicken thoroughly done. The taste was perfect and not burnt or dry at all. I was so excited that I cooked whole bonely breast two days later and can't wait to grill the shrimp and vegetables this weekend. Beware though, the thickness of the meat will cause a lengthy grilling time. So, the house will be full of smoke (for the inexperienced cook like me), but the meat will not burn or dry out.

This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get"}

Most impressively, the blades show very little wear, despite the fact I have certainly used them quite often.

In the case of this purchase, I saw the item during an early bird sale at Kohls, so I grabbed it. I owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness, but it is really bulky, so I thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice. On the contrary, it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse, and although it was on sale, it was a waste of money. The problems I had were: 1. The cord is too short: directions instruct user to hang nozzle on the door hook which hangs over the top of any door. The nozzle would not reach to the top of the door, and I live in a mobile home, so it is not like I have the tallest doors in a home. 2. The most important thing in steaming a garment, for me, is to avoid the garment getting wet. I did not fill the steamer to the maximum line, because I know from past experience that this could sometime cause the spitting affect. After 2 minutes of waiting for the steam, I began to try it out on a silk blouse, and what a big mistake I made. The water spat out on the material. I thought that I should not hold the nozzle so close, but it did not matter, because water continued to spit out on the blouse. 3. The steam pressure would not dewrinkle the blouse. The is not a case where the material was so hard to dewrinkle; it is silk, not that hard of a material. I have read other reviews, and if this machine worked for them, I don't know how, but I can attest to the operation of the steamer that I purchased. I dabble in selling clothing on another website, and I have owned my other steamer since 2002, and I will continue to use it; I will just have to deal with space that it takes up in my home.

This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2-qt Iced Tea Maker. Even though I/we haven't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee. First of all the taste (using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers. Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket, for the bags, sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir, where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher. Because Hamilton Beach placed the basket directly inside the Pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker. Also due to ridges in the bottom of the Mr. Coffee maker it's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it. This feature alone makes the Hamilton Beach a better buy over the Mr. Coffee but I thought, before my purchase, that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both Lipton and Luzianne Family Tea bags the Hamilton Beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste IS Better. On the Mr. Coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the Hamilton Beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket (mild, medium, strong), we usually use Medium. We enjoy \"Sweet-Tea\" being from the South and anyone that makes good sweet tea knows you sweeten it while it's hot at the time of brewing. Our method is to first fill the pitcher to the line and fill the reservoir and refill the pitcher to the same water level and then add 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar and stir with a whisk until very well mixed. Once the tea is brewed you have to stir the tea again but you get perfect sweet tea every-time. If you enjoy tea, even if you never considered an electric tea maker, the Hamilton Beach will be one purchase decision you will not regret. Having two Mr. Coffee makers before this Hamilton Beach I don't see myself ever purchasing another Mr. Coffee unless they make many changes to their product and even then taste is the final decision maker. I HIGHLY recommend the Hamilton Beach model and would gladly buy it again even if it was higher priced than the Mr. Coffee, it's totally worth it"}

I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point. Cuisinart's one has obviously some problems: 1. Bread tends to be darker so quickly and becomes hard. 2. It is very noisy during kneading cycle as I can not hear the music from the audio. 3. Paddle is caught in the bread and hard to remove it if you do not remove it before baking cycle starts. 4. Some basic cycle have no \"Pre-heat\" cycle. It means I need to prepare exactly appropriate temperature water to make yeast work nicely. But it is very hard and sometimes I fail. 5. The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if I do not mix it using a spatula. One of my friends owns Panasonic bread maker and showed it to me. I was so surprised at it as the thickness of the case is very different. She has never had such a problem which I have had. Then I decided to get Panasonic one although my first one is still working. The bread maker was delivered in 2 days. I tried same recipe which I often used for Cuisinart's. The bread came out amazingly nice and much nicer than the one from Cuisinart. Bread is nicely blown, crispy outside and soft, fluffy inside. It is just perfect. I guess these difference come from mainly these things: 1. The case is very thick so that bread can not be brown so quickly and keep the inside of bread soft and flavorful. 2. \"Pre heat\" cycle adjust the temperature of water well. I do not have to make appropriate temperature's water any more. 3. This machine has the special room for yeast. It works very well to keep yeast away from the water particularly using the timer. I think I never back to Cuisinart although I miss some points (Sophisticated design or the window on the rid which I can see inside of the case through) of Cuisinart a little bit. I highly recommend this bread maker."}

Maybe my unit is defective, because other reviewers don't mention this, and believe me, you would notice this if it were occurring with yours.

Perhaps those with the heavier motors work better? I have the smaller motor (250 W) K45SS mixer. Surely KitcheAid must read these reviews. I would expect some additional user information for this product on their website, but see nothing. Very disappointing product and consumer support.

{"id": "kitchen_&_housewares-positive-620", "domain": "kitchen_&_housewares", "label": 1, "text": "The scale I received from Amazon looks the same as the picture for the \"Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale\" but it's a different model. The one I received uses the CR-2430 lithium battery, not four AAs as advertised. Also, the product manual is different. The actual manual's title is \"67000 - 67007 g/oz,\" not \"8122/8123 g/oz.\" On the bottom of the scale, there is a number similar to Soehnle's product numbers, 812215. But I could not find such a product anywhere. Fortunately, the maximum weight capacity of this scale is 5000g as advertised. It's actually about 5280g. The unit of measure is in 1g or 0.05oz increments. Weighing items with this scale is very easy. The LCD screen has large 0.5\" numbers. It has a 2-minute auto shut-off switch, and a supposedly low-battery indication. Overall, this is a very good scale and I recommend it if you're willing to put up with purchasing a lithium battery once in a while"}

My only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split (a bit), but it still fit together, so I kept it (excuse the rhymes, please). It's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books, including some big heavy hardcovers, 20 DVDs, 3 DVD box sets, 12 videotapes, and a few pictures and knicknacks. And yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom. Best part: the ease with which you can put it together. I have MS, so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal.

{"id": "kitchen_&_housewares-negative-809", "domain": "kitchen_&_housewares", "label": 0, "text": "The FS150 food slicer is fine for very light duty work such as cheese or lunch meats providing you don't push this unit too hard or use it too frequently. Ours lasted a year and a half of very occasional use before it burned out. The two biggest drawbacks are the sliding rail and the motor/gear train. First the slider is simply a cheap plastic bushing on a metal rod that tends to bind up fairly quickly. We found that a little olive oil wiped on to the rod kept things moving well enough but it needs to be treated every time you use the slicer and then cleaned afterwards. Food grade Teflon or silicone spray did not seem to work as well as the olive oil. The big problem with this unit is the motor/gear train that drives the slicing wheel. The drive gear is plastic and will not tolerate any kind of continuous load and will strip out fairly easily if pushed too hard. We smoked the motor and stripped the gears just slicing up a couple of small roasts and we were not working the unit that hard. It does a decent job for the person that just wants to slice up a small bunch of deli foods for a party or do a weeks worth of cheese for the kids lunches but honestly a good knife will do just as well and not set you back ten minutes for cleaning every time you use it. If you are looking for a slicer to do more serious work you will have to spend the money and get something in the $400+ range. What this slicer is good for the deli counter can do for you for free when you buy your bologna."}
