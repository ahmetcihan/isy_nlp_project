{"id": "dvd-positive-760", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "A fun musical comedy, THE TROUBLE WITH GIRLS isn't the usual Elvis Presley film but it's completely charming with it's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast. Presley plays Walter Hale, manager of the traveling \"Chautauqua\" tent-show, circa. 1927, who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show. Hale finds himself falling in love with Charlene (Marlyn Mason), organiser of the children's activities; whilst trying to help local single mother Nita Bix (Sheree North) when she murders her nasty married boyfriend (Dabney Coleman). Presley's numbers include \"Swing Down Sweet Chariot\" and \"Clean Up Your Own Backyard\". It's certainly a lot better than some of the other Elvis films from the same period; and seeing Elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat. Marlyn Mason, probably one of Presley's most formidable leading-ladies, is stunning (and her rendition of \"Sign of the Zodiac\" is a knockout). Nicole Jaffe (as the amorous hotel clerk), Vincent Price (eccentric speaker \"Mr Morality\"), John Carradine (as a colourful Shakespearian actor), Joyce van Patten (disgruntled former channel swimmer Maude) and Edward Andrews (as Hale's beleaguered assistant) are also fine.

{"id": "dvd-negative-204", "domain": "dvd", "label": 0, "text": "Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done, my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun. The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha. For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making."}

It combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy one-liners, and some jokes that still today make me laugh. \"Lookin' good, Princess! 'Specially from THIS angle!\" As children we see Link yell that to Zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences. But later, that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee, and wonder how we ever missed it before. But the series is most enjoyable for those of us who faithfully stuck to the actual video game series. The implimentation of original 8-bit sound effects into the cartoon is an added bonus that draws us back for more. And waiting to see which classic Zelda enemy will cause Link and Zelda trouble next is just that much more fun (especially if you can name them). But by far the most fun thing about this show is waiting and praying for the day when Link can coax a kiss out of the lovely Princess. And they've come so close it almost made me angry when they got interrupted. Link tries so hard, and makes such an idiot out of himself trying, that you'd think he deserves a little action once in a while. but every time, no matter how he tries, he either messes up or is interrupted by Ganon's non-stop attempts to steal the Triforce.

Having money left over from my birthday, I decided \"Hey, why not buy yet another Wuthering Heights DVD?\". I was a little skeptical about how it would be, seeing as all the adaptations I've seen thus far haven't really taken the whole story into account. Of course, to do so would be a hard task for a movie. The story is complex and not a very average-movie-goer sort of plot. I was disappointed in the 1992 version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, although it's a good enough movie (as long as it didn't have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights as the title...). Other versions were all right, and although the 1939 version didn't showcase the second generation of the story, I found it better than '92. Needless to say, when I popped in the DVD, I was hooked by the first five minutes. Sure, the movie isn't EXACTLY like the story (I want you to show me a movie that is. And, as I said, this story is complex for the movies). Some of the things that are different/changed/added/etc., are the fact that, once again (as in many of the movie adaptations) Nelly is old from the start. Also, Heathcliff and Cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place (such as when they visit the Lintons). Most \"Wuthering Heights\" fanatics know that Heathcliff and Cathy never consemate their relationship. However, there's many a kiss in the movie. There are some other details of the movie that are different than the story, but I, a crazy \"Wuthering Heights\" and Bronte admirer, give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan"}

{"id": "dvd-positive-673", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "Watching \"Once and Again\" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again. This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date. I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them. Watching \"Once and Again: The Complete Second Season\" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning. There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family (\"Scribbling Rivalry\"). Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again. If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through. If the first season of \"Once and Again\" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance. There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., \"Scribbling Rivalry\") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell (\"Edifice Wrecked\"), than there is about them being with each other. While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, \"Feast or Famine\"). The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well). So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother's daughter, which is not always a good thing (\"Best of Enemies\"), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating (\"Food for Thought\"). Having Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on \"thirtysomething\" all over again. But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick (\"Ozymandias 2.0\"), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot. This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live. But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting (\"Edifice Wrecked\"), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison (\"Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight\"). When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious. This really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters. Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun (\"The Other End of the Telescope\"), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby (\"Forgive Us Out Trespasses\"). Judy comes up with the great idea of \"Booklovers,\" despite Lily's negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck. Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music (\"I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down\"), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue. Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December. I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation. So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli's parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation. My only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental. At least when she does not immediately accept Rick's proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring. The fact that season two ends with the wedding (\"The Second Time Around\") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking \"Once and Again\" was simply about Lily getting remarried. It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD"}

{"id": "dvd-positive-648", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "\"The Bells of St. Mary's\" was a shrewd move by Paramount Studios and director Leo McCarey, whose successful prequel film about the likable and practical Catholic priest Father O'Malley, \"Going My Way\", spawned the 1945 release, which included an additional element that provided the basis for an interesting psychological conflict. Irish Catholic McCarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed \"Going My Way\" and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the Catholic world inhabited by Father O'Malley. Bing Crosby had garnered a Best Actor Oscar for \"Going My Way\" and McCarey secured the services of the beautiful Ingrid Bergman to play Sister Benedict, the Mother Superior of St. Mary's School. Crosby found himself immediately clashing with Bergman on certain points relating to the parish, but through it all a mutual respect existed between them. Each realized that the other was committed to the best interests of St. Mary's. Dudley Nichols, a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award winner a decade earlier for the John Ford film about the Irish political conflict starring Victor McLaglen, \"The Informer\", directed his effort in the script toward presenting Crosby and Bergman in periodic conflict, but learning from those experiences. Much of the contrast, they realize, stems from the way that men and women view situations. One phase of the film showing this difference is when Bergman teaches a young student who has been victimized by a bully how to box as a means of restoring order. She feels a tinge of guilt since the youngster's failure to fight back and receipt of a beating in the process stemmed from his obedience to her stricture against fighting at St. Mary's. When Crosby pursues a conventional macho posture in extolling the need for protecting oneself and praises the fighting skills of the bully, the nun has had enough. She purchases a boxing instructional book written by former heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and adeptly instructs the obedient youngster in the manly art of self-defense as he ultimately teaches the bully a lesson. Crosby recognizes her teaching skill and becomes cognizant of the strength of her feminine viewpoint. An area where Crosby and Bergman cooperate is in seeking the answer to the nun's fervent prayer. She believes that of the mortgage holder of their property, Henry Travers, who has built a modern building next door and seeks to use the church property for an employee parking lot, may through prayer and proper persuasion be convinced to give them his modern structure. The result would be a new school and no further need to use the tired current facility. The effectiveness of Crosby and Bergman stems from their soft sell technique with just the right pinch of Christian charitable thought thrown into the mix. Travers, who cannot sleep nights and experiences heart problems, confides to the priest and nun separately that he wishes he was better liked. Their soft sell approach in advancing the \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\" precept along with the accompanying feel good element of charity prompts Travers to see things in a light more favorable to the interests of St. Mary's. Crosby and Bergman are delights to behold in this feel good film. They provide challenges to each other through disagreement and an effective front when they team up on the issue of greatest importance to them, the welfare of St. Mary's parish."}

It just didn't really click with me, and it wasn't anything near the great movie I'd been hoping for, so when its sequel was released I didn't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released. A bit surprisingly though, I thought \"Hannibal\" was really great once I finally did see it. Everyone said it was more geared toward horror than \"Silence...\" (which is fine by me) and it may have been, marginally. But much more than that, it was just a Better horror movie than its predecessor, and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie, in my opinion. Hopkins is just as good, if not better, than he was as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the first time around, and while I usually don't like recasting roles in a movie (unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice, and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong) Julianne Moore did a great job stepping into the Clarice Starling role originally played by Jodie Foster. The movie centers around the hunt to find Lecter by the only victim of his original, pre-incarceration, carnage to survive - a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against Lecter. It seems like \"Hannibal\" has changed tract from \"Silence\" and is implying that most if not all of Lecter's victims May have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves. Whether that's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible, the effect was to create a foil for Hannibal who's even more evil than he is. Hannibal Lecter himself is, well, he's not a 'good guy' in this movie; he is, though, presented in very cryptic shades of grey. His behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real, and he's much more interesting as a character this time around. Clarice also is; she comes across here as a character who's somehow traumatized, perhaps even mentally unbalanced, deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like Lecter to ever see it, and that's what so intrigued him in the first place. One possible interpretation of things overall (and this is just one of many potential takes on it; the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it - making it a great source of conversation for movie-lovers) is that Hannibal Lecter is a person who had/has the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil, while Clarice Starling has the potential for great darkness and Hannibal-level violence in her, but chose to be good, chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness. A lot of food for thought in this one (no pun intended). Great performances all around; in notable addition to Hopkins and Moore the brilliant Gary Oldman plays Lecter's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and under-rated Ray Liotta plays an unlikable, rather creepy FBI agent who's constantly at odds with Starling. A very, very engaging and wel-made movie"}

Needless to say, Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel Jackson, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful!

It was this scene where he filled in for radio personality Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams) who was on reportedly on special assignment. Adrian arrives in Vietnam from America via aircraft. At first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the Vietnam radio airwaves. But they discover that Adrian's brand of humor is outrageous,very much like Howard Stern in real life. They also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing. Hey,this was(set in) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones from the United Kingdom. When Adrian and Lt. Hauk first met,the lieutenant told Adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself. When the lieutenant first heard Adrian on the air,the lieutenant was not pleased at all with Adrian's stint. \"You oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music',not wild stuff\",Lt. Hauk told Adrian in a meeting. The 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like Andy Williams,Perry Como,Mantovani,Jim Nabors,Lawrence Welk,Frank Sinatra and Percy Faith. \"Would Bob Dylan be out of line?\",Adrian asks Lt. Hauk and the lieutenant replies,\"Way,way,way out of line!\". Adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in Vietnam and they hoped that Adrian would permanently do his morning show there. The brass decides to suspend Adrian,bringing heartbreak to fans. When Lt. Hauk did his stint,many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted Adrian back on the air. One listener said in a letter,\"Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls.\" Another wrote to Lt. Hauk,\"You suck,eat a bag of s--t!\". So Adrian is back on the air but not for long because Sgt. Dickerson(the late J.T. Walsh),the top man of the brass,demanded that Adrian be cancelled. Sgt. Dickerson's superior loves Adrian and even demanded his reinstatement. Sgt. Dickerson is transferred to Guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant's abusive attitude. The title of this film is how Adrian began his morning show. On the very last show done by Adrian's friend Lt. Ed Garlick(Forrest Whittaker),Ed began the show saying,\"Good morning,Vietnam\",just like Adrian. Ed tells listeners about Adrian's departure from Vietnam. We hear Adrian saying,\"Goodbye,Vietnam\" in a pre-recorded message. Adrian also left Vietnam because of his association with a criminal who's the brother of a Vietnamese woman Adrian befriended. Other funny scenes include Adrian teaching the Vietnamese how to use profanity,Adrian doing a parody of the late Richard M. Nixon on the air and Adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield. This film was a megahit for both Williams and director Barry Levinson. They were both at least nominated for Academy Awards. Levinson did win a Best Director Oscar for his next film,RAIN MAN. This film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like THREE MEN AND A BABY. Both films were made by Touchstone Pictures,a division of Buena Vista Pictures. THREE MEN AND A BABY was a megahit as well. Both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. THREE MEN AND A BABY inspired a sequel,why didn't GMV?

{"id": "dvd-positive-468", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "This is one of my favorite horror movies of the 1980s. It's an updated version on an old theme: Save the young heroine from the evil, blood-sucking vampire. Chris Sarandon (Lifetime Movie Channel staple) has an absolute field day playing the villainous Jerry Dandridge. Amanda Bearse (\"Married with Children\") plays Amy, the young high school target of Dandridge's desires. And William Ragsdale (a Hollywood newcomer at the time) plays Charley, the young hero who does his best to convince others to help him save Amy. No one really believes Charley's rantings that his new neighbor next door is a vampire. Charley's geeky best friend (played devilishly well by Stephen Geoffreys) doesn't believe him; nor does Amy. Desperate, Charley enlists the help of has-been horror actor and TV host \"Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer.\" Equally desperate, Vincent takes the job as Charley's \"savior\" because he was fired as TV host and needs the money. Roddy McDowall plays Peter Vincent extraordinarily well - first as an actor out to (wink-wink) \"convince\" Charley that Jerry Dandridge is NOT a vampire, and then genuinely terrified when he discovers evidence that Charley's suspicions are true. Dandridge, upon meeting Amy, sees her unearthly resemblance to a woman he once loved. He is immediately infatuated with the young girl. But first, realizing his secret is out, Dandridge acts quickly to rid himself of the problem of Charley and his pesky friends. The special makeup effects in this film are terrific and imaginative. The script is tightly written and well acted and Tom Holland's direction makes it work. (Holland's other works include \"Child's Play,\" \"Thinner,\" \"The Temp,\" and \"Thinner\"). The DVD transfer is sharp and clean. The disc features both a standard full screen version (4:3) and a widescreen version (2.35:1). Sound is presented as 2-channel, Dolby Surround. The only DVD extra is the theatrical trailer. Sub-titles are available in several languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.

Stuff like the Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much. The idea of slow walking killers going after Olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me. Of course the major draw was the death scenes: elaborate moments of viciousness. Flinging Jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it's a good kind of laughing for some reason. Jason is in the future in a facility on a planet, except he escapes(of course). Disposing of scientists, including The Fly and Scanners director David Cronenberg, he ends up getting cryogenically frozen, along with another scientist. Flash forward 400 years and a ship discovers them and founds out, ooh, a nice reward for Jason. As usual he comes to life and does what he does best: kill attractive looking hotties. You don't go to these movies to expect well-written dialogue, character depth or anything, you come for the kills and to tell you the truth, they're slightly disappointing. Besides one kill, which answers the question of what happens when a frozen face hits a hard surface, the kills are kind of been there/done that. It's basically stab here, impale there, it seems kind of unimaginative. A few even happen off screen with the yelling off in the distance. Characters are just there to be taken care of brutally and some are. However, Jason does what I'm starting to hate is kill off the very cute girls. One girl, wearing a top with a belly showing gets disposed off(off screen) and I'm like \"damn guy, let one cute girl live for once!\". Dialogue is of course stupid but there were some funny lines. A self-deprecating parody about the sex teens have in the film is referenced. \"We love premarital sex!\" is so classic, as well as \"it's okay, he just wanted his machete back!\". Granted they won't make an AFI list but they made me laugh. It's the kind of movie that you probably weren't supposed to like: it was ridiculous and dumb but boy did it seem fun.

First a word about my setup, which is nice but far from optimal. The HD-DVD player is connected via HDMI to a Sanyo PL-Z4 projector, with an approximately 140\" picture thrown onto a light beige wall. The room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades. Hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado's but my family and I thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it. Now about the title - there are no compression artifacts or mosquito noise to be found anywhere. None. I also bought this title on SD-DVD and have watched on an upscaling DVD player, both on a 57\" crt bigscreen and the projector, and there are a distracting number of the aforementioned artifacts and mosquito noise in both cases. They're most noticeable on large surface solid colors, of which there are many in this movie. You'll see them \"dance\" and shimmer on SD-DVD, not so on HD-DVD. The colors are bold and bright when appropriate, but what really struck me while watching the title were the drabbish gray scenes such as the snow-covered streets of the town with the factory looming in the background. You can make out more detail, without any obvious edge enhancement problems found in the original SD-DVD version. The lights from the townsfolk dwellings were suffused with a soft glow in this latest version, not a ringed mess. The story itself is not necessarily an improvement over the original, rather its told from a slightly different perspective, giving more insight into Willie Wonka's character, and updating the other kids (Violet, Mike Teavee, etc...) to reflect a newer generation of youngsters. Mike feels a bit weak, he's portrayed as a videogame crazed violent kid in the sequence that introduces his character, then sort of disappears into the background the rest of the movie. Veruca and Violet by contrast are more prominently featured, and you'll develop more antipathy towards their characters by their actions throughout the movie. Augustus also suffers a bit but since he's the first to get ousted from the party, it's logical that he won't be as fully developed as a character. His romp through the initial scene whilst in the factory is pretty good however. Overall I'd give this 5 stars not only as a visual and audible feast for HD-DVD owners, but felt the movie was a great update to the original and stands on its own merits, even in SD-DVD presentation"}

{"id": "dvd-positive-110", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "This is the best film I've seen in perhaps six months or more. The direction by Turkish/Italian director Ferzan Ozpetek is consistently interesting, intriguing, beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually. The film is beautifully cut, and the acting, particularly by the fascinating Giovanna Mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also Giovanna, is first rate. The story begins in a bakery during World War II when Davide Veroli (Massimo Girotti) is a baker's apprentice. We see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the cave-like establishment. But he is pounced upon by the baker. They wrestle, a knife is grabbed and apparently the baker falls and there is blood on Davide's hands as he runs out into the streets. Cut to modern times as Giovanna and her working-class husband, Filippo (Filippo Nigro) are crossing a bridge in the city. They meet an old man who seems lost and disoriented. He can't remember his name and he has no identification. Filippo takes pity on him and against his wife's wishes takes him home with them to their apartment. We know because of the man's age that the mystery of who he is has something to do with the men in the bakery scene from World War II. But his story is only tangential to the central story of the film which is about Giovanna's brief affair with the man next door, Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), whose apartment window faces hers. This is a love story, a bitter-sweet one--which all great love stories should be in some sense, since life itself is bittersweet. It is framed by, and contrasted with, another love story, that involving the older man from many years ago. The tension in the film revolves around the resolution of the affair between the married Giovanna and the handsome man who will soon be leaving the city. Will she abandon her marriage and her family for the excitement of a new man? Because the police can find out nothing about the old man, and because Giovanna's heart softens toward him, and because he is an elegant man of refinement, especially in the pastry arts--Giovanna's dream is to be a pastry chef--the man is allowed to stay for a while and the two are drawn together into friendship, the old man and the young woman. That's enough of the plot--the development, the denouement, and the resolution of which are beautifully realized in both an artistic and an emotional sense. Instead let me say that the feel of modern Italy with its racial tensions and its old world versus new world differences are nicely expressed as the past makes itself felt on the present. The dialogue is wonderfully expressive and gives us the sense of authenticity and the kind of realistic effect seen only in the very best films. This is the first film directed by Ozpetek that I have seen, but it won't be the last. But see this for Giovanna Mezzogiorno whose beautiful and expressive eyes and natural demeanor will hold you to the screen"}
{"id": "dvd-negative-272", "domain": "dvd", "label": 0, "text": "\"Capote\", directed by Bennett Miller with a conscious sensation of subtlety and a slow pace, was widely acclaimed by critics after its release in 2005. It is based on Gerald Clarke's 1988 non-fiction book \"Capote: A Biography\". The film starts by Capote's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) interest in the Kansas crime merely as a reader and ends with him becoming the most famous writer on the crime. His knowledge of the criminals, especially Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), which started from the newspapers elevated to an intimate yet undefined relationship. The writer is sympathetic and sees in Smith a strong resemblance with himself, yet he uncaringly and mendaciously uses him to get to his aim. Capote was looking for something to write and indeed he found it. \"In Cold Blood\" was his most famous novel; the one that established him as a legendary writer. He was left overwhelmed, confused and unsatisfied, however. The movie is quite ambiguous, though. Characters are marginally defined and the dialogue wavers between witty to irrelevant or inexpressive. At many instances it is hard to grasp the causes and consequences of specific situations and conversations. For instance, people are always laughing heartily at what Capote has to say, although he never actually says something funny or worth a great deal of laughter. The setting and the music were both barely significant. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is highly remarkable, the actor's resemblance of Capote is questionable. Hoffman is 5'10\" and more stout than the slender, barely 5'2\" Truman Capote."}
{"id": "dvd-negative-57", "domain": "dvd", "label": 0, "text": "This review is more about the \"SuperBit\" transfer of the movie to DVD than the movie itself. The movie itself is great and I highly recommend it. However, the transfer on to this 2002 \"SuperBit\" version is very lacking in several areas. The SUPERBIT idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer. The original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features (like trailers, documentaries, featurettes, and \"Making-Of\" snippets) to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality. They have failed to do that here. The video and audio quality are not what they could be. First, the movie is encoded onto a DVD-9 RSDL disc. This means the DVD is capable of storing 9.5 GB of data. However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, the video and audio quality is not what it could be. \"Panic Room\" is a 112 minute movie. Any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a DVD-9 disc at maximum encoding rate, provided no extra features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour (or less) movie onto a DVD-9 disc is 9.8 Mbps. However, this SuperBit version averages only 6.5 Mbps. This SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1. At first glance this is great news, until you discover that the DTS encoding isn't as high quality as it could be. The DD 2.0 Surround is presented at a bitrate of 192bkps as expected. So is the DD 5.1 at the expected 384kbps rate. DTS 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps, but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps. This is unsatisfactory given the fact that one-third of the available disc space of the DVD-9 isn't even used. The DTS encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this. This would represent a 33% increase in filespace for the audio portion, but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear. The filespace increase would be only about 256 MB, which is very reasonable when you have over 3 GB of space not even being used. If they had encoded \"Panic Room\" on this SuperBit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 Mbps, and removed the trailers and features, they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above, especially the DTS 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate I stated. Such an encoding process would have used 9.4 GB of the 9.5 GB of available space. A much better way to fill up the DVD-9 disc and adhere to the spirit of the SuperBit ideal. The result would have been a movie encoded to DVD-9 at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc. I notice that they will be offering a repackaged SuperBit version in October 2006. Hopefully that version will fix the flaws I just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both video-wise and audio-wise. It might even offer the better DD-EX 6.1 and DTS-ES 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many A/V receivers can process now. Another thing I am noticing is that many times, for popular movies, they are released them in 2-disc editions. The first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff. If the movie contains both DD and DTS encodings on the first disc, with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 Mbps or greater, it is already in the SuperBit mold."}

THE CAMERA REACHES THE BASEMENT, OUT POPS THE CRYPT KEEPER WITH HIS MENACING CACKLE* \"TALES FROM THE CRYPT\". This show is one of my all-time favorites. I used to sit in front of the television with my father every Saturday night when this show came on. The stories in this show were so amazing and so well done, that I couldn't help myself when I became hooked on the show, and I was only four-years-old when this show debuted with its first season back in 1989. TALES FROM THE CRYPT takes you on a journey through six horrifying episodes, each one scaring you in one way or another. This here first season only includes six episodes, but all six are very terrifying, and many ways, rather comical as well. #1: THE MAN WHO WAS DEATH (aired June 10, 1989) This spook-tacular episode shows a man named NILES (played by William Saddler, who would then go on to take the male lead role in the first-ever TALES FROM THE CRYPT motion picture entitled, TALES FROM THE CRYPT presents DEMON KNIGHT), who has spent the last twelve years of his life shooting electricity into prisoners, sending out their life sentences. But now, a law has been passed to ban the life sentence, for even executing murderers and law breakers is \"Still Murder Within The Eyes of God\". Niles then appears in a few court cases where the defendants happen to be let off the hook, despite the fact they are indeed guilty. This leaves Niles to privately execute the defendants, where it leads Niles into his own arrest, where is then in for a \"Shocking\" surprise. #2: AND ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE (aired June 10, 1989) In this chilling Holiday-filled episode, a woman murders her husband in cold blood on Christmas Eve. As she tries to bury the body outside in the freezing cold snow, she neglects to hear on the news that an escaped mental patient as broken out of the sanitarium, and has already killed four women in the county. The news has even stated that the patient has been seen wearing a Santa Claus suit, a suit he had stolen from one his victims. The mental patient stumbles upon this woman, practically killing her, but she seems to have killed him by stabbing him in the stomach. As she gets a hold of the police on the phone, she is told by the police to look around for a weapon to use, since she has informed the police that the patient has gotten up and entered her house, after she stabbed him the stomach. She goes into the closet to get her gun, but the door locks. As she pounds on the door, trying to get out, the patient climbs up to the woman's daughter's bedroom, with the daughter thinking that's it the real Santa. She busts through the closet and finds her daughter safe and sound, holding \"Santa\" by the hand, with her mother screaming at the top of her lungs. #3: DIG THAT CAT...HE'S REAL GONE (aired June 10, 1989) In this brilliant episode, ULRIC (played by Joe Pantoliano) comes across a seemingly mad scientist, who gives Ulric an offer he can't refuse: Have the gland of a cat inserted into his brain to give him the ability to resurrected after he is killed. The surgery goes successful, where Ulric becomes a classic act at the county fairs. He has been drowned, shot in the heart with an arrow, electrocuted, and many more. But he just kept coming back from beyond the grave. Here is now about to pull his next death stunt: being buried alive for twelve hours, and then resurrected. But...wait a minute. Ulric has already died and been resurrected...nine times. #4: ONLY SIN DEEP (aired June 14, 1989) In this sexy and beauty-filled episode, SYLVIA (played by Lea Thompson) is a 21-year-old hooker, looking to quit the business and clean up her act. She does so with the money she has robbed from her pimp...after killing him. She goes into a pawn shop to have her pimp's jewelery, but the pawner reveals that the jewelery isn't worth crap, for the jewelery is \"hot\". But he's willing to pay Sylvia $10,000 for her \"beauty\". He informs her that if she wants her beauty back, she has to get it back within a four-month period. Okay, whatever, you old whack-job. Sylvia goes through with the pawning of her beauty and goes out on her way with her 10 Gs. She meets a playboy and begins dating him. Four months go by and Sylvia begins seeing some odd changes in her complextion. She goes to a dermotologist, but he cannot seem to figure out what is wrong, where it is then and there that Sylvia figures out that the pawner was not kidding. She demands her beauty back, but the pawner will only sell it back to her for...$100,000. She kills her playboy boyfriend, and scrapes up every piece of jewelery he ever bought her. She gets her beauty back, which was formed in a plaster-of-paris head of her own self, but it ends up being smashed to pieces when one of Sylvia's hooker friends bumps right into her, not recognizing Sylvia, for she has become so hideous, like an old, disgusting haggard witch. #5: LOVER, COME HACK TO ME (aired June 21, 1989) In this ciller, Charles has found Peggy, the perfect girl. Peggy has found Charles, the perfect man. The two have married, against the wishes of Peggy's aunt. On their way to their honeymoon, they are stranded into an old house, where they have to succomb into spending their wedding night in this disgusting old house. Peggy wants her wedding night to be perfect, so consumating their marriage on the sofa is not a good idea. Comsumating their marriage in a bed is much better. They do their thing, and they both fall asleep, where Peggy says in a sort of joking way that they've made a child, a little girl. Charles falls asleep, but he wakes up to the sound of Peggy entering the house with another man. He watches his own wife screw another guy on the sofa, where they guy falls asleep, while Peggy tells him of how they've just conceived a child, a little girl. She then picks up an axe, leans over to the man's ear and simply says, \"Peggy would make a great name for our little girl, wouldn't it?\" She swings the axe and kills the guy she just had sex with. Charles wakes up in horror, for it was only a nightmare, but it was a nightmare about a true fact: Peggy's mother had killed her Peggy's father on their wedding night, after they had consumated their marriage, where her mother and father had just conceived Peggy that very night. Peggy's mother said she did it to consume the perfect love to a perfect wedding night. But Charles claims that he didn't marry Peggy out of love. He married her for her money, and he was going to murder Peggy that very night, report to the police that an accident had happened, where he would inherit the money, but Peggy has made a change in plans: continuing her family tradition, which is: Murdering her husband to consume the perfect love on the perfect wedding night, after consumating their marriage, which led into the conception of their daughter. #6: COLLECTION COMPLETED (aired June 28, 1989) In this lame episode, Audrey Lindley (the actress best known for her role as HELEN ROPER on Three's Company) plays a lonely housewife, who's husband named JULIAS has just retired. One the first day of his retirement, her husband is already going crazy because of all the animals his wife has in the house. She continues to claim that she does not want to get rid of the animals because they are her \"friends\", they've kept her company all those years her husband had spent working, instead of paying more attention to his own wife. Days go by, and the house is seeing less and less of the animals. Julias then shows his wife where all the animals have gone: in his basement...stuffed. The last animal to be taken care of is a cat, but Julias' wife bashes his skull in. But the next afternoon, she is sitting in the living room with Julias, talking to him as if he were still alive. Their friendly next-door neighbor drops by, where he discovers Julias' stuffed body. This was a great season. But stay tuned, Boils and Ghouls. There's plenty more terrifying tales to come in the following seasons *CRYPT KEEPER'S CACKLE"}
{"id": "dvd-positive-780", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "The enduring legacy around Fran�ois Truffaut's emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from Henri-Pierre Roch� semi-autobiographical novel. And in showing that elusive rapport, Oskar Werner, Henri Serre and especially Jeanne Moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the French New Wave. Fortunately, the two-disc Criterion Collection DVD set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic, although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times. The story focuses on the friendship between two writers, an Austrian named Jules and a Frenchman named Jim, kindred spirits who enjoy a decadent lifestyle in pre-WWI Paris. Inspired by a statue of a woman's face with a most enigmatic smile, they agree that they are destined to fall in love with a woman with the same smile. Enter Catherine, as seductively capricious a free-spirit as ever there was in cinema, and the two men are instantly enamored. Jules is intent on marrying her, even though it's clear from the outset that she is not one who could commit for the long term. The war intercedes, and the two friends are fighting on opposite sides. After the war, Catherine, married to Jules and raising their young daughter, is emotionally dissatisfied and embarks on an affair with Jim. With Jules' blessing, things are idyllic for a while, but Jim proves too much the alpha male to defer to Catherine's whims, and the resulting imbalance leads to increasingly dramatic consequences. In just his third film, Truffaut's trademark style emerges with fast cuts between scenes and naturalistic camera movements (courtesy of Raoul Coutard's fluid cinematography). Moreover, George Delerue's animated music score and Michel Subor's voiceover add to the evocative photo-album memory atmosphere. At times, the storyline feels a bit disjointed, but the fulsome performances more than compensate. Werner fully captures the internal struggle within Jules in attempting to reconcile his love for Catherine with her impossible demands on him. Serre has the comparatively more objective role but convincingly shows his character surrendering to the tangled situation. After her impressive turn as an obsessed adulterer in Louie Malle's \"Elevator to the Gallows\", Moreau solidifies her vaunted reputation here, conveying Catherine's petulance and unyielding passion in a vividly mercurial fashion. The DVD extras are abundant starting with two commentary tracks. The first one, a more factual account of the production, was recorded in 1992 with Truffaut collaborator Suzanne Schiffman, editor Claudine Bouche, co-screenwriter Jean Gruault, and scholar Annette Insdorf. The second, produced in 2000, is far better as it has Moreau sharing her personal recollections of the filming with Truffaut biographer Serge Toubiana. Disc One also includes a brief 1966 interview with Truffaut discussing Roch� and a 1985 featurette, \"The Key to Jules and Jim\", which contains interviews with the author's friends as they discuss the inspirations for the characters. Disc Two takes a broader look at Truffaut with five separate interviews with the director over the span of fifteen years, as well as insightful interviews with Coutard and co-screenwriter Jean Gruault"}

When watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock, its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center. Attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is asked to defend Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) after a bar owner is found murdered. Manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife, Laura (Lee Remick), was raped. While preparing his case for trial, Biegler finds that Laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature. Nevertheless, the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him. Stewart is his dependable self in \"Anatomy of a Murder.\" In fact, his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film. There is little nuance in the performances of Gazzara and Remick and even the great George C. Scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort. Yet, the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay. \"Anatomy of a Murder\" oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story. The investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction. For a film to run as long as \"Anatomy of a Murder\" does, one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film.

NO and was very prominent? In the scene where Bond kicks and tosses Quarrel and Puss Feller into a stack of corrugated cartons, notice that those cartons are labeled `Red Stripe.' That's right, `Red Stripe' Beer from Jamaica! In this case `Product Placement' was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film. In fact DR. NO is one of the best films of the series. It is much closer to Ian Fleming's prose than most of the other films thanks to Sean Connery's performance, Richard Maibaum's scripting and Terence Young's direction. At the same time other elements that would be unique to the series and distinguish it from other films were introduced here. Production designer Ken Adam's sets, attractively futuristic yet totally simplistic and functional, adorned by Syd Cain's detailed Art designs set the look for the entire series making their work in DR. NO the benchmark. Peter Hunt's intuitive and effective quick-cut editing paced the film like no other at its time. Maurice Binder's brainchild opening `gun barrel' is an incredible piece of Title Design, which is equaled only by the `James Bond Theme', composed and re-orchestrated by Monty Norman and John Barry. Ted Moore's cinematography, especially the shot of bikini clad Ursula Andress emerging from the sea, is now a classic and also set a standard for future `Bond Girls.' We are introduced to the organization known as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in DR. NO. What is unique to this film is the main villain brilliantly portrayed by Joseph Wiseman. He is unlike future main villains of the series. He isn't exactly what you may call a `social animal'. Joseph Wiseman's eerie and surreptitious portrayal made Dr. No one of the most mysterious and enigmatic of the series. In a way his portrayal seems like a model for the unseen Blofeld in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL. Rounded out by the beloved M portrayed by Bernard Lee, the lovely Miss Moneypenny played by Lois Maxwell, John Kitzmiller as Quarrel and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, DR. NO ranks as one of the best."}

I just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK (region 2). This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is. It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts) and goes though the Hal Roach Features. All the prints are restored and of pristine quality. A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys. There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons) such as Babes in Toyland, The Devils Brother, Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces. To acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon,which is the only way to go if you really want to collect. The DVD player was very cheap. plays beautfully and is well worth the investment. As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics, in case you don't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films.

In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium. It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and \"The Mummy Returns\" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting. \"The Mummy Returns\" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. \"The Mummy Returns\" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences. FINAL ANALYSIS: \"The Mummy Returns\" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball. Needless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. \"Returns\" put an end to that."}

Joe Gillis (William Holden), a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers, holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. While walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool, he is shocked to discover it's occupied by old silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Living with a devoted chauffeur, estranged from Hollywood and forgotten by fans, in Desmond's mind, she is still a star working on her next big roll in a script she has been scribbling for years. Knowing the script doesn't have a chance, as a writer, Joe looks at this as an opportunity to \"fine tune\" it to earn some extra cash. However, the working relationship is not all that tidy. It seems lonely Desmond is looking to sponsor a gigolo. His payment is a warm place to stay at night, a closet full of clothes, nice meals, private \"parties,\" and Desmond's ever-present company. If it were possible for Desmond's self-admiration to be supplanted by anything, it would be the possessiveness for Joe's affection. Young Joe needs a break from such austere surroundings and eventually goes out to a party with real people and meets a girl engaged to an old friend. Through a series of secret rendezvous they begin to collaborate on a script with real potential and, naturally, develop feelings for one another. The girl may be willing to sacrifice her engagement but breaking free from the tentacles on SUNSET BOULEVARD is a formidable challenge. With some of the most memorable quotes in Hollywod, this is a wonderfully produced \"noir-comic\" drama by Billy Wilder that well projects the intense emotions, not only of each character, but of the large group of people in the entertainment industry they represent. Other highly acclaimed movies that fit in with this genre are ALL ABOUT EVE, AN IMITATION OF LIFE, and WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE. A gem on the DVD extras is the history of fashion legend Edith Head. Movie quote: \"There's nothing tragic about being fifty. Not unless you're trying to be twenty-five."}

{"id": "dvd-positive-734", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "SPOILERS When Star Trek's production crew started falling behind in both schedule and budgets during the first season, they came up with the brilliant idea of using the unsold The Cage pilot as the basis for a two part episode. The result: One of the most important and brilliant Treks ever done! Everyone knows the basic plot by now: Spock kidnaps his crippled former Captain, and hijacks the Enterprise, and sets course for the one forbidden planet in all The Federation. He eventually is court-martialed en route, and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the Enterprise's visit to Talos IV 13 years prior. THIS is the episode which cements Spock's character forever: the supposedly emotionless Vulcan, who demonstrates more passion and loyalty than most humans. Leonard Nimoy's performance is one of his best as Spock : initially seeming as though Spock had gone crazy almost, kidnapping Pike, using false computer tapes and voices to convince people that the ship is under 'secret orders', all sorts of indications SOMEthing must be wrong with Spock...until after the Talosian's plan is revealed,where it is found THEY have been manipulating events all along, and Spock returns to his stoic self.....except..when leaving the briefing room with Pike for the last time, his head bowed, shoulders slumped. Shatner's understated performance in this has been sloughed off in some circles. I say :'unfair'...Frankly, it is PERFECT for the events - all during these events, Kirk acts rather stunned at all these events: His friend and 1st Officer has seemingly gone crazy and hijacked his ship, he almost dies going after him in a shutle, THEN he is releived of command for all of this! By the time the Talosians supposedly abandon Spock and forces the trial board to take a vote, even Kirk is convinced Spock should be put away.But..at the end..is able to smile when the Talosian shows him the 'rejuvenated' Pike happy again at last. All of these performances are directed with care by Marc Daniels, the veteran TV director who was at the helm of the 'envelope'. They make an deliberate point of cutting to the more mature, unemotional Spock during the famous 'laughing' scene,and you can ALMOST see a flicker of 'was I THAT emotional?' cross his face! The makeup used on Sean Kenney, the 'substitute' Captain Pike (Jeffery Hunter was unavailable),might be some of the best ever done for any Trek: it holds up totally through repeated cuts back and forth from the pilot footage: you are totally convinced this is an older, horribly maimed Jeffrey Hunter! Some small parts of The Cage are cut: some shots of Pike's fellow 'zoo-mates', some VERY sexist lines about 'women on the bridge', and the obligatory 'aliens running through the computer' scene. None of these are very important to the plot of EITHER the pilot or the envelope. And just to add some trivia: Part II of The Menagerie was the highest rated episode of Star trek ever in prime time! Actor Malachi Throne had been the original voice of the Talosian Keeper in the pilot. Since he was cast as Commodore Mendez, voice artist Vic Perrin was dubbed in as The Keeper. As per the Director's Guild, Marc Daniels was credited as director for Part I, while the director of The Cage, Robert (Mr Pilot) Butler, was given the screen credit for Part II. The Menagerie is amazing experience from start to finish!"}

With a hard-edged view of the world as: \"There's no such thing as adventure. There's no such thing as romance. There's only trouble and desire\" (actually from a Fritz Lang movie of the 1920's) there's plenty going on to both prove and disprove Hartley's ambivalent theories. Simple Men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious Elena L\u001awensohn. In one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50's beatnik-style dance to Sonic Youth's \"Kool thing.\" Then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number.

It's really a well-done movie, very classy and hip. Altman also satirizes Hollywood power players extremely well - it's a whole other world out there in LaLa land"}

And well I waited months and months, wondering waiting for it to come out, I went there with 3 other friends and it was the thing of a life time. Then it was time the P%$%# @%#T DVD of the century. THank you EMI for destroying a historial document so you can get all your SIGNED Contracts on to your DVD. Well now all I have to do is use my Time Machine and Get a tape ready and tape the Damn concert. Wait TIme machines doen't exist well now I am going ot have to go underground to get it. But wait I still $100 will EMI Release all the videos on DVD or do we have to go underground to get it from someone who tapped it and is selling it. All I can say this is why the internet was invented for INFORMATION EXCHANGE. If they keep information paticularly this Historical Document from people, they will share it over the internet. The video doesn't belong to 1 Company it belongs to the world, the world created this and WHO does EMI think they are by limiting this. I am so sick and tired of this utter B$%# @#$T. No one should settle for this, I demand more and Everyone should demand more also.3 Billion People watched 1 million spectaters. And what does EMI Tell you, they will put the crappiest DVD together and then make everyone take the videos down of there website. I believe I shall find them all and put them up on Wikipedia because it isn't 1 Person who owns the worlds creation. Anyone who believes in this should know what it means to them Every Extra CEnt of this DVD should go to AFrica and it doesnt it and its a Bloody shame.

I think it has great replay value & as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness. I found it more reminiscent of the old 60's films like 'Monte Carlo or Bust' or 'Those Magnificent men....'. Jackie Chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the action-packed foil to 'Fillius Fogg' played with brilliant English reserve & self-deprecating humor by 'Steve Coogan'. There's no comparison to the original & the film doesn't even try to copy. Rather, it takes a silly story with silly character's puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family action/adventure/comedy movies you'll see. Because this isn't a typical 'Martial Arts' vehicle for 'Jackie Chan' I found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline. Check out for instance the fight-scene in the Art-Gallery which goes to show why 'Jackie Chan' is probably the best Action/Comedy star in the world right now. There's much that's Chaplain/Keaton-like in his performance & all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts. The guest-stars are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices, most notably 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' (What I think is the best Comedy ever & this is by no means a comparison). Anyway 'Arnold Swarzenneger' in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a Turkish Prince no less (Possibly the poorest Arabian impression ever, which is of course why it works so well) and 'Rob Schneider' has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice. Miss 'Cecile de France' is a beautiful Comedy foil & manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent & I hope to see more from her. You might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but I found a lot of it to be nicely restrained, this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set, check out the extras. All in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy/Action/Adventure with ne'er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing."}

Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise & fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,- You MUST be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children.

The epically long \"Begin the Beguine\" is the climax of the movie & it makes the whole mess worthwhile. The last 11 minutes of this movie are mind-blowingly great -- absolute perfection. The sets, the cinematography, the costumes, the orchestrations & the extraordinary routine itself -- everything combines to make \"Begin the Beguine\" the most ravishing, glamorous black & white production number ever put on film. It's Hollywood at its apogee, the quintessence of silver screen glamor. A few of the other numbers are fun: the first, \"Don't Monkey with Broadway\" is clever & pleasant; later on, Fred Astaire's lovely \"I've Got My Eyes on You\" is also winning: a charming routine that he dances to a delightful, cheerful orchestration. Some other numbers are worth seeing, as well, but \"Begin the Beguine\" outshines everything else in this picture. In between the numbers, there's a lot of dreary silliness afoot. Happily, DVD technology makes it easy to skip over the dross & go straight for the gold. Eleanor Powell was a very odd actress. She was rather pretty & decidedly perky (how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality); she was also quite feminine.

These films waited a long time to make their bow on DVD, much too long for myself, personally. I always loved these films, they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time. Each of the three films is very different from the others. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", the first and best of the three, introduces us to Indiana Jones, perhaps Lucas's greatest creation. Premiering in 1981, this film was a smash, also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture. Also starring was Karen Allen, perhaps the most even-matched female co-star for Harrisan Ford. It seemed she could give as good she got, and never backed down in any scene. Second was \"The Temple of Doom\", easily the darkest of the three, and the most intensely exciting. This film is a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish, and doesn't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor. The third film, \"The Last Crusade\", is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor, and has the wonderful Sean Connery to steal every scene he's in. The interaction between Indy and Mr. Jones is wonderful. If anyone was to ever play Indiana Jones' father, it was Sean Connery. The forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features, which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves. These films waited far too long to be released to DVD, and I lay the blame squarely on George Lucas. I've heard he really didn't think DVD would take off like it did, that it was just a phase. It's great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy. As with his \"Star Wars\" trilogy, the Indiana Jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all DVD collections"}

I still can't understand why the critics just didn't get this one. This has to be one of the best second films ever made in a Trilogy. The addition of Davy Jones was brilliant. It made the film much darker and more dramatic. Johnny Deep was superb as usual. I still can't believe that the film made $400 million dollars domestically and over $1 billion dollars worldwide. It's surreal. But everything about this movie was so on point that it's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film. I enjoyed this one more than the original. I thought the story was more interesting on this occasion. Although, you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of Geoffrey Rush's character. He and Depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him. It was a huge void to fill. But enter Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and all is well. I guess that's one reason why \"Dead Man's Chest\" woks the way it does. Billy Nighy gives an A-list performance. And when you add in Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, it's money in the bank. The only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original \"Star Wars.\" Yes, I prefer \"Pirates\" over TLOTR. Although, perhaps my comments are premature since \"At World End\" hasn't even been released yet. Should that be a dud, then of course the whole thing falls apart. But here's hoping that the third time is a charmer. If you own the first \"Pirates\" on DVD then you have to get this. Don't miss out."}

He is very encouraging throughout. The workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used (two dumbbells needed). There are a few innovative moves thrown in as well. Since the difficulty level of any workout video is relative, I'll give a quick background of myself - I run 4-5 times a week, for a total of 40+ miles/week. I also lift weights 2-3 times a week, incorporating plyometrics and compound movements. I've personally found David's boot camp video to be just the right amount of intensity when using 5-lb dumbbells and think this one-on-one video is great for days I have less energy. Regardless of fitness level, you are sure to enjoy this workout. If you need to make it more intense, use heavier weights. The biggest thing to remember about David's style (in my opinion) is to really *focus* on every repetition, *focus* on the muscle being worked, and *focus* on isometrics (contracting the muscle without movement - eg. pushing against a brick wall is isometric).

{"id": "dvd-positive-520", "domain": "dvd", "label": 1, "text": "Over the years, people have grown tired of natural disaster movies. Why? Because they all appear to be the same. Here's an example of a typical storyline- everything starts out nice and calm, the story focuses on one family, the family starts having problems and they split up, and then a volcano, tornado, hurricane, or whatever hits, and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger JUST so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie. Well, that kind of typical storyline isn't featured here. Twister is truly a classic. It's not ordinary, either. It's about a group of tornado chasers who, as you guessed, drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get never-before-seen film of a twister, up close and personal. This means the film delivers the most amazing action I have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie. Twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films, and I remember in 1996 how influential this movie was. I was in 9th grade, and the science teacher played Twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was SO good and much better than other tornado films. Helen Hunt plays a magnificent role. She is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she's going through. What's great about this is that, despite giving us a really good story about a divorce, this doesn't interfere with all the tornado action. There are *so* many good scenes in Twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it's simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie. Favorite scenes? Well, everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air, so I won't pick that one. I really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater, tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it. That's just one of MANY awesome scenes. The storyline is really good too. It's not just a story about a divorce between Helen and her husband. There's a lot more to it than that. It's complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action (against her will). This is such an awesome movie. I highly recommend it. Tornado movies don't GET any better than this. Pure action from beginning to end. You will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger. Twister will make you think twice if you're thinking about becoming a tornado chaser."}

Like the Liger match, this was a fast-paced and solid 20 minute match. 8.5/10 Wild Pegasus VS Black Tiger[Eddie Guerrero]- These two have had some far better matches, and this is one of those that I wished would have been replaced by something a little better. Still a solid match. 7/10 Chris Benoit VS Too Cold Scorpio[ECW]- These two have some nice chemistry together.

Slow-paced match until towards end. 6.5/10 Chris Benoit VS Kevin Sullivan[WCW Nitro]- This was an all out brawl, going all over the arena, including the bathrooms.

Stone Cold Steve Austin does guest commentary. 9/10 Chris Benoit VS Kurt Angle[Royal Rumble 2003 WWE Title Match]- Benoit and Angle put on another classic in the main-event of the Royal Rumble.

Ong Bak is pure action excitement - don't expect a deep story and do expect horrible English dubbing that is just down right annoying (you can still switch to subtitles with Thai spoken if desired). If these 2 things don't matter to you, this movie just plains rocks. Its a bit slow here and there, but overall it is filled with all the action you could want - illegal club fights, an incredible club brawl fight, tons of stunts and chases, a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars, a ring fight, and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts, lasting for a good 10 minutes. I also liked the background music for the movie - lots of smooth laid-back hip hop beats. I'm pleased to say that with newcomer Tony Jaa to the world of martial arts films, the loss of Chan and Li someday soon won't be as bad. Ong Bak is brilliant action and originality. The only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing, which Chan and Li movies do much better"}

Perhaps it is not fair to compare their techniques as Arrau's technique was always not that impressive. Yundi Li is not just a virtuoso. You are impressed not only by the shattering way he played for the more emotional part of this piece ( when Liszt was supposed to struggle with his other side of character), you will also be impressed by his every subtle nuance for the lyrical part of the music which you seldom hear from others. You will also appreciate all the smooth transitions he made from one theme to another. Will I be able to hear a better and a more logical Liszt's B Minor Sonata than this? I believe Yundi Li is capable of very deep feeling when he plays. You seldom find one pianist more deeply immersed in the music during performance than Yundi Li . Music just flow out from his fingers in a most natural way as a result of such deep feeling. I particularly agree with this description of Yundi Li: \"What distinguishes this uniquely gifted young artist from most of his contemporaries is his ability to put his personal stamp on a work without resorting, even for a single gesture, to eccentricity.\" Although Richter was technically more capable compared with Arrau, I have always found him not expressive enough for pieces that require more rubati. You will be impressed by his technique for some Beethoven Sonata."}

Most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers.

I still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that I never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet. The bonus features are splendid as well. If you watched everything this DVD has to offer it would take up about 1/2 of your day probably, there's that much on here. Just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs, Brandon recording Warning (a lot of this song is a capella), and Incubus showing how funny they really are. The original cut of the Wish You Were Here video is also on this, which is pretty humerous. A few of the best songs on here are Pardon Me, The Warmth, Warning, New Skin, and Nice To Know You.

Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars. Was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb? Possibly, but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube's \"reality\" shows and less than funny comedies. Was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting? Maybe, but Carla Gugino (Molly), Charles Dutton (Blaylock), Brent Spiner(Fenway), Rob Benedict (Lucas), Peter Dinklage (Ramsey), and Brian Holt (Cavennaugh) did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters. Sadly, they didn't have the opportunity to finish the job. Was it cancelled because it didn't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes? Arguably, but the team did offer some great visuals, interesting plotlines, and nightmare scenarios. So why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated? Probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer doesn't appreciate a good story takes time to develop (The X-Files, Alias, 24, Law & Order, CSI, Smallville, Numbers, etc.).

Jack Black (KING KONG) returns as another obsessive character in Jared Hess' latest cinematic offering, NACHO LIBRE. Most will remember Hess for his stunning direction of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. Here he gets a bit more money for production and gives us a hilarious tale of a Mexican monk who's early dreams of becoming a luchador (wrestler) come to fruition later in life. Jack Black plays Nacho, a cook at an orphanage/monastery where his talents as a chef come into question daily. But the one thing Nacho yearns for is to become a professional wrestler. His contact sports passions are reignited by the arrival of a beautiful nun named Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera (LADIES NIGHT), and by a wily thief named Esqueleto (SUPERVIVENCIA), a streetwise thug with bizarre moves. Esqueleto and Nacho team up and eventual take to the ring, only to be beaten time and again, but still making money. But making money isn't enough for Nacho (\"I want to win!\"). Vanity gets the better of Nacho and he tries everything to achieve his goal of becoming a winner, including finding a shaman who gives him sketchy advice regarding eagle eggs. Finally Nacho learns that winning comes from within and uses his \"inner\" strength to make his way to the top. Silliness occasionally racks Nacho Libre, but it is saved by Jack Black's incredible physical comedy. Not since SCHOOL OF ROCK has he been so well cast. The training scenes alone are worth the price of the rental (Cow dung to the face? A wasps nest to the head? Shooting Esqueleto with a blunted arrow?) When Nacho tries to court Sister Encarnacion, the comedy is further ratcheted up as Jack Black uses his butt-muscle tone in a nut cracking fashion!

While they rally the convinced, having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful. To wit, about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage. About the \"movie\": it's actually a filmation of the presentation Al Gore has made for some time on Global Warming. In it he tries to make the case that nearly everything we are measuring on this dynamic earth is the result of man-made CO2 and other green-house gasses. The audience is bombarded with a long series of charts, graphs, and suppositions that make for a compelling argument - IF one has little or no knowledge coming into the presentation. And this is where this production goes terribly wrong, the fact checking was terrible, the cherry-picked data was obvious and heavy-handed, and finally the movie ends up serving those who oppose any discussion of global warming more than it helps the cause. Two examples: An Inconvenient Truth asserts that a sea-level rise of 20 feet is a realistic short-term prospect - yet, the 2005 joint statement by the science academies of the Western nations warns of sea-level rise in the four to 35 inches range in the 21st century. Gore discusses the Earth's atmosphere as relatively thin, and declares that, \"The problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of carbon dioxide.\" Hello? Thickness has nothing to do with global warming people. Carbon dioxide has molecular bonds that vibrate on the same wavelengths at which infrared energy radiates upward from Earth's surface - meaning that the vibration warms the CO2, which makes things hotter. Further the references to nitrogen are pure nonsense, since it doesn't play a role. My warning is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process, no matter how noble the cause may be."}

When Sixth Sense came out, he was tipped as the next big thing, but I'm sorry to say, it's no longer there. In my mind, he cannot match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of Sixth Sense. Signs just fails miserably. The concept was a good idea, but the execution was terrible. It reminded me very much of Blair Witch Project, as in what little action there was happens off screen, and the torches as well. It's also definitely not Mel Gibson's best film. Even the actors appear to struggle with the dialogue-heavy script, and not really much happens. Apart from one brief glimpse of an alien. Oooh. Fascinating. The problem I think that Signs has, is that it's already following many other, far superior, alien movies. Aliens attacking the earth has been done, and lots more memorable than this. There's also the overly religious theme, which the film probably would have done better either toning down, or scrapping altogether. It was really just thrown in to try and justify what was happening in the film. The scenes between Gibson and his kids and his brother are way too sentimental and really cringeworthy. The finale doesn't really make the film better. The discovery that the naked aliens find water like acid to their skin is atrocious! Why come to earth, the surface of is mostly covered in water, and the atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour?! And then they travel millions of light years with far advanced technology - and then can't break into a wooden house?! Are you kidding me?

I was psyched to purchase this DVD the minute I heard about it. What a let down! First of all, How did Freestyle achieve all of the acclaim and all of these film festival awards, Secondly who picked it as a winner? Probably some cornball who isn't familiar with the culture or good off the dome MCing? This documentary tries really hard to connect to the audience and present the validity of rhyming off the dome but falls completely flat. The film isn't balanced enough to a certain degree. What you basically have is nothing more than a bunch of tree huggin backpackers spitting nothing but junk and 10 syllable words off the top of their heads for a majority of the film. Don't get me wrong there are some credible scenes in Freestyle with Mos Def, Biggie, Black Thought, J.U.I.C.E, and the Last Poets....but not enough. Freestyle tries to come off as some profound documentary but sheds very little light to the subject and the questions that many Hip-Hop heads have asked for years. Why wasn't the current trend of fake freestyles (writtens coming off as freestyles) addressed more? Why weren't more credible MC's exposed and quality underground MC's presented? Why is there a section entitled \"written/freestyles\", what kind of oxymoron is that? It makes no sense. Why is there a section on Freestyle DJing??? What???!!!? Isn't that called turntabalism??? It seems as if they're fishing for more topics that ultimately don't have much of a direct relation to rhyming off the top. Is there a freestyle graffiti section too??? Freestlye continuously fails and derails itself off track from the key subject, the art of freestyling. At times it tries to be a Hip Hop 101 DVD. Most of the people who will be purchasing the DVD are already familiar with Hip Hop's roots in the South Bronx. Where is the quality freestyling at? Ultimately, \"Freestyle\" is over-saturated with un-proven, extremely weak, amateur MC's who need to focus more on spitting quality off the dome freestyles. They cover Supernatural's sorry a$$ for almost half of the entire DVD, which is very unfortunate. I admire his creativity, but he sounds terrible. It's no wonder why he can't get signed. He thinks his doo-doo doesn't stink, because he's studied the dictionary to help expand his vocabulary for freestyling, but yet he can't take the time to concentrate on getting out of the broom closet that he lives in. I thought that this film could have benefited from more footage of proven vets who can truly freestyle such as Kool Keith, Tribe, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-1, Snoop, Kurrupt, Common, Safir, Likwit Crew, Redman, or anyone from Hieroglyphics. These aforementioned artists can \"really\" freestyle. That would have faired much better than watching these tofu eatin, incense burnin, soy milk drinkin, poetry night geeks struggle to put words together. The Eminem rap Olympics footage from 1997 would have been great too. Ultimately, if you are somewhat/vaguely familiar with Hip-Hop culture or a new fan of the underground scene, then you will love Freestyle. If you consider your self a long-time fan of Hip Hop culture and familiar with the topic of freestyle rhyming then you will be somewhat disappointed, just like I was. If you want a quality Hip Hop DVD purchase check out \"The MC\", \"Scratch\" or \"Hip Hop Immortals\" take my word for it. I'm rating this with 2.5 stars mainly for the rare footage of artists such as Kool Moe Dee, Bahamadia, Biggie Smalls, The Roots, Craig G, and Kool Herc"}

With non stop action, drama and comedy, Kellys Heroes has it all with a top notch cast and soundtrack to boot. The original script of a bank heist behind enemy lines during WW2 is a classic and is brilliantly executed at all levels. Even though the film is based on a fictional plot, it still has an authentic feel and is rated an all time classic. highly recommended"}

I pass them walking around the house humming the music and even asking for art materials to try some of the things they have seen in the video. Best educational video I have seen for motivating the creative side of children and it has motivated me to buy other Brainy Baby videos. Try it-you won't be dissapointed!"}
