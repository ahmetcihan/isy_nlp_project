Not too long ago I recently acquired the Calphalon grill pan because my Foreman grill is too small if I want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time. Plus the black coating on my Foreman grill is wearing out. So I bought the Calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store. I haven't been able to get enough of it. It is so easy to clean even when I had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in Italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed, garlic, shallots, and extra virgin olive oil. The marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it wasn't non-stick. I also like using the Calphalon grill pan because I can cook both the meat and vegetable (say asparagus) at the same time. The results are fabulous. I get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste.

{"id": "kitchen_&_housewares-positive-858", "domain": "kitchen_&_housewares", "label": 1, "text": "Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products. Le Creuset casts these cooking vessels from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once. For this reason, one pot may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. It is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat. However, there are exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so are these cooking vessels. Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain your cooking vessel. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood. The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the buffet casserole specifically. The buffet casseroles are one of the most versatile pieces in the Le Creuset lineup. Use this pan as a saut� pan, a roasting pan, for poaching, or as a shallow braiser. The 3.5 quart capacity can is plenty of space when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. The buffet casserole tends to do best if at least three quarters full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with the evenly dispersed heat in the pot. With a large flat bottom that curves up this pan resembles a curved sided saute pan the only thing missing would be a long handle. The tight fitting lid is mostly flat with curved sides. This lid seals in heat, moisture, and flavors and can be used to hold your meat while you are making a sauce from the drippings. Its shape and design makes this an extremely versatile pan. I tend to use this pot for basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else. But once you get past the basic functionality that lends itself to recipes such as paella, frittatas, deep dish pizza, and casseroles, you can really open up the possibilities. Keep in mind this is a 3.5 quart pan, feeding two out if it is ridiculous unless you want leftovers. It is probably the perfect size for a family of four in most cases. Try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding for when you need to please many guests, poaching fish, or Mac and Cheese. The possibilities almost seem endless. One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. PROS: Extremely versatile Efficient absorption and distribution of heat Hygienic enamel cooking surface Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors Easy to clean when not abused or misused Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table Can easily last a lifetime CONS: Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 12.25 pounds"}

Even though I also own Global and Shun kitchen knives, I find myself being drawn to the Insignia knives when I am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project. Although both the Global and the Shun have sharper edges, their price difference doesn't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get. That is to say, yes Global and Shun knives are sharper, but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that. Using my Insignia knives, I am able to quickly dice, cut, and slice through onions, carrots, chicken, roasts, etc. That said, there are several cavets that need to be stated. First, don't wash these knives in a dishwasher. It has nothing to do with the quality of the steel. I wouldn't wash my Ken Onion Shun Chef's knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the Insignia. Second, these knives need to be honed regularly. A few strokes after every use makes a real difference. Third, after owning the knives for almost two years, I sharpened each of the knives on oil stones. These knives, like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time. The good news is that they resharpened quite nicely, a tribute to their quality. Since resharpening, they have continued to hold their edges. Last, the balance of these knives is more than adequate. I also own the matching sanduko and have found it to be the best of the series. All though I am a bit of a knife snob, and although I would love to purchase a block set of either the Shun or the Globals, I can't justify it given that the Insignia's cut so well.

And the infuser is too small for my taste to allow proper steeping of all the tea leaves, especially when I'm not planning to fill the pot to the brim (it doesn't extend deep enough). So I don't use it at all (I put the leaves directly into the pot and use a strainer as I pour). However, my biggest gripe is that the spout does tend to dribble after you pour. So you have drops of tea trickling from the spout to the bottom in between pours, ending up with a wet spot on your table/counter. I have to make sure I either wipe the spout in between pours, or set it on a dishtowel/paper napkin (unless I'm planning to pour tea to multiple cups in one session). I found that pretty annoying.

As other reviews said the rake only goes over the top half of the litter so there's tons of sticky cement left at the bottom which you have to manually scrape out. It was often unable to push the clumps into the bin. So it would just very noisily push until it got stuck, back up, and then start over again like 10 times in a row. When it does get clumps into the bin, it also pushes tons of litter through the crack between the bin and the box and then you're left with a huge pile of litter underneath the box. To clean it, you have to take it apart. The top part houses a computer so you can't soak it which means there's poo always stuck in the crevices. Ever see Office Space?

{"id": "kitchen_&_housewares-positive-724", "domain": "kitchen_&_housewares", "label": 1, "text": "Very good buy for $85 +free ship. Bought this one to replace a smaller Black & Decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5-6 years until controls gave out (the B&D still works, just have to keep the button pressed in). I looked at reviews of several toaster ovens before purchasing the T-Fal. The less expensive ones ($25-$40) were getting dinged because of occasional mentions of overheating or fire risk. Not worth the chance. I also wanted something as small as possible because we have little counter space in our 10' x 10' kitchen, so a more expensive one was not an option. The T-fal gave dimensions on Amazon & it was 3 inch wider, deeper, taller than our B&D. No big deal - wrong. It was bigger than I thought when I put it on the counter, looked like a monster compared to the B&D. Also, I could not open the top warmer lid to the point it stays open. This because of height restrictions -- bottom of my kitchen cabinet is at about 54 - 60 inches. I can open the top, but I need to hold it open. My fault, not the product or mfr. But be aware that size matters in a small kitchen. The function buttons are very simple, nothing complicated - one button for toast, one for bake, another for broil. You can set how long it stays on, and it beeps (electronically) three times when it shuts off. There is a clock, but it could be easier to set. I mainly use it to toast bread, bagels, sandwiches and to bake small pizzas (sauce with cheese on a pita - easy). The toast function takes longer than the old B&D (about 4.5 vs 2 minutes), but thats OK by me. The bake function works very well, I prefer it muchly over starting the oven to bake something small. Clean-up is a snap with a removeable crumb tray, glass doors and non-stick surfaces. Negatives: you can pull the rack out about 30-40 percent before it tips forward and burns you. It's controllable, not a big deal, unless you don't know about it. I did know thanks to previous reviews and I was prepared for it. The fan was louder than I expected (I expected no noise since the B&D has no fan). But it is a soft sound, lower than my computer fan and only on during cooking. Overall, it's a well built, well-designed machine."}

Now however, with this pizza stone, I no long find myself ordering pizza for delivery. 1 cup water or beer 2 1/2 cups flour (maybe a 1/4-cup of whole-wheat flour mixed in) 1 package of dry yeast 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon butter Knead and let rise twice (I used to do it by hand, but now I have a bread maker which works perfectly for this purpose on the 'dough' setting). This makes two pizzas around 14 inches in diameter. Either roll them out with a rolling pin, or press them into shape by hand. The dough seems to be too elastic to \"throw\" it into shape - I think it's a skill that takes a long while to master. I make pizza sauce with a can of tomato paste, some red wine and/or water, chopped parsley, chopped basil, dried oregano, chopped garlic and chopped onion. I've also used pasta sauce (prego or ragu) with acceptable results. I almost always top with mozarella and thinly-sliced mushrooms. I use parchment baking paper under the pizza. I slide it on and off the stone this way, without resorting to corn meal. This works perfectly for me every time. Heat the oven up _HOT_ (500 degrees). It will only take 5 minutes to bake at this temperature. When the cheese is beginning to brown around the edges, it is done. The crust is golden-brown on the bottom, with just a bit of crunch. If I let the crust rise a bit after preparing the pizza, it will be softer and thicker. Store-bought frozen pizzas are also better when cooked on this stone. I'm giving only 4 stars because of the price. There must be a cheaper alternative to this stone, but I'm not complaining too much, because I've thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas it's produced"}

The Farberware pan was a joy to use when I first bought it and I loved the even heat. All of the positive comments are accurate at first. The problem is it only lasted 3 months before it lost it's nonstick properties almost completely. I never used spray on oil or subjected it to high heat. I was always very meticilous about the way I cleaned it and never touched the surface with anything but plastic. I even bought a special soft plastic cleaning brush so as to be very delicate with the surface. I have been using nonstick skillets since they first came out many years ago. With the exception of one ultra cheapo model I have NEVER had a nonstick that had its nonstick go bad so quickly. Of course I can send this back to Farberware but it seems clear that if it has lost it's nonstick properties they only have to say it was my fault. Why waste $10 in shipping costs? This is my last Farberware product. After writing this first part of the review I thought it would only be fair to email Farberware to let them respond. After doing some googling I have found that there is no email. It is also basically impossible to get someone on the phone. They sold their warranty service to a different company, All American Lighting in Berwick, PA. As it turns out this company gets terrible feedback for their service.

I tried jamming a wooden spoon against it to hold it shut while cooking, but found this sort of absurd. So I called Cuisinart for warranty service. They said they'd replace my oven with a new one, but I had to pay to ship the oven to their warehouse in NJ and it would take a few weeks. In the meantime my husband found a set of little magnets at our local craft store, and fixed the problem! So I wasn't going to ship the oven to NJ - until a replacement oven arrived...before I even sent the first one out. Hmmmm. Anyway, we're enjoying this toaster oven very much and use it practically every day. It is slower than a regular toaster, but cooks four pieces of toast/waffles all at once, so I figure its a fair trade. It does a nice job with open-faced sandwiches or chicken nuggets for the kids on the broiler pan, without having to heat up our full-sized oven. A practical choice especially for families with kids"}

{"id": "kitchen_&_housewares-negative-193", "domain": "kitchen_&_housewares", "label": 0, "text": "This machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned European-style coffee drinker (coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean, not a tall cup of Sanka as the term is used in the US). Admittedly, I'm really picky about my coffee, but $250 for this machine is ridiculous. I've had coffee from a $40 Krups machine that is better than that made by the EspressoPro. I use high-quality pods with this machine (Molinari, Lucaffe, and Miscela d'Oro) which guarantees consistency in other machines, but doesn't help with this machine. Here are my issues with the machine. 1. The thermoblock isn't effective. I HAVE to put water in my espresso cup and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds before making an espresso or else my coffee will be lukewarm. Disgusting, even with high quality beans. Granted, unless your machine has a cup warmer, this is probably a good idea regardless of your machine, but with this machine, it is a REQUIREMENT, not an option, if you want hot coffee. Second, steamed milk is lukewarm on a good day. The same heating problem occurs with steaming milk. I called Capresso, and they said to check all the fittings. In fact, after much frustration (I'm not an idiot), I finally just sealed the connections with shrink tube, which leaves only two points where the connection could be weak. Still, I can't get HOT steam. What I do get is either lukewarm liquid milk, or cool, overly thick foam. In fact the foam is so unrefined and thick that it gives the impression that you could chew it. Nasty. 2. The frothing mechanism is gimmicky and not effective. A standard \"frothing wand\" is much better. The mechanism on this machine is ineffective, lacks true control, and requires an extra step over a standard wand to clean. As explained above, the heat is not sufficient, and the quality of foam is irregular and bad. I'm embarrassed to serve coffee from this machine to guests, let alone drink it myself. I just can't get over the heat issue. Nothing kills a good coffee than lack of heat. This point is so important, if you take a gander at the Francis! Francis! X1 (and professional machines), there's a thermometer right on the front of the machine (and no, it's not purely an esthetic design issue since you can put several types of gauges/switches on an espresso machine--like a pressure gauge). The low heat generated results in really thick, solid foam. When I have guests, I just heat milk on the stovetop and use a handfrother instead of using the EspressoPro's lame mechanism. Second, the way you adjust the foamed milk to steamed milk ratio is not effective. A little gate is regulated by the user through a twisting tab. It's just not good design. Since the milk actually passes through the machine and is heated internally by the machine, you can't really \"work\" the milk. A wand offers direct control and offers immediate visual response to whether you're getting foam or hot milk. You know dried milk that collects on your steaming wand? Well, that's now inside your EspressoPro. With a traditional wand, you just wipe the wand with a wet rag. With this machine, you need to run hot water through the frothing mechanism (BEFORE you do this you need to wait for the block to heat up again). Plus, there's so many little pieces that need to be kept clean, it's a pain. What a bad design! 3. 18 Bar? Yeah, right. This machine also doesn't generate enough pressure to develop nice crema. Granted, I use pods, but still, a certain amount of crema is expected. This machine produces a thin, insufficient amount of crema. The lack of sufficient pressure probably has to do with the poor thermoblock. I really can't recommend this machine. For $250, just go get a Krups or Braun. Better yet, spend $50 more and get an entry level Gaggia or Saeco. With this machine you're paying for looks and a gimmicky, ineffective frothing mechanism. This hunk o' junk is now buried deep in the back of my kitchen cabinet, as I truly would not feel right pawning this machine off on someone else. It is now appropriately \"retired\" from service, and I now enjoy perfect coffee every day from my Saeco Vienna Superautomatica. Now that's a machine, baby"}

{"id": "kitchen_&_housewares-negative-191", "domain": "kitchen_&_housewares", "label": 0, "text": "The frother is great! Easy to use etc. The espresso temperature is 140 degrees F when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes. At that LOW temperature you can't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso. Other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate. This occurs when the grind is too fine. I've had this machine for over a year and it is NOT recommended. I use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine. To add insult to injury, the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap. I thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble. Previously I had a Gaggia which is superior in every manner, and cheaper also. The only reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the frother."}

My experience was that the probe failed to register temperatures above 100 degrees celcius. It would get there and just freeze. Additionally, the design of the thermometer makes it difficult to read exactly where your temperature is. This makes it unsuitable for most candy-making where the difference of a degree or so could be critical. The physical design of the thermometer feels very sturdy and is a nice stainless. It is rather deceptive since you think you may be purchasing a higher quality tool than you are actually buying. All said and done, after you replace the sugar, flavorings, creams and other ingredients from your spoiled batches of candy...and pay for the gas to run these errands ...the cost of using Robinson's Pyrex Candy Thermometer goes way up. Use a cup of ice water. Or a more reliable brand of candy thermometer. It's much better to shell out the extra dollars and get beautiful consistent results"}
