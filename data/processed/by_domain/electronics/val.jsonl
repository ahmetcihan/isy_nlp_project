{"id": "electronics-negative-957", "domain": "electronics", "label": 0, "text": "First - a disclaimer: I know very little about telephone headsets, but decided to buy one because I had a series of long telephone meetings coming up. I walked to my local Staples store, expecting to find a variety of prices and products - and thinking that I'd pay perhaps $30 to $50 at the low end of the market. At the store, I found that only the computer-based headsets were that cheap - and the only model that worked on a real, old-fashioned land line was the Plantronics S11 on display (it was priced at $130 Canadian). Since work was paying for it, I didn't mind spending the extra money, but expected that, at that price, the quality and ease of use would be quite high. When I brough it back to the office and installed it, I found that: - The regular handset and the headset cannot be plugged in at the same time. That means that every time I want to use the headset, I need to fumble around at the back of the unit to switch wires. - The volume of both ingoing and outgoing conversation is very low - even when I turn up the volume controls to max. The people I spoke with complained enough that I switched back to my regular handset. - The microphone, although it's somewhat adjustable, is short and inflexible enough that I can't get it very close enough to my mouth. When I try to move it closer, the earpiece turns and slips off my ear. - The headset itself - that is, the plastic, adjustable arch and rubber pad opposite the speaker - is very awkward and prone to slipping off my head. It might have been better to design it like a regular two-sided earphone unit - so that it would be more balanced and stay secure. I don't know whether these comments apply only to the S11 or to most headsets for traditional phones in general. Overall, however, if I'd been buying the S11 with my own money, I would likely have returned it and just gone back to using the regular phone handset"}

Easily enough, as it turns out. I was unable to load it and control the play lists. Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop. Dragging a folder to the device was pointless. Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place. I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from \"My Computer\" on the host system. After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out. I have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method. This was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb. Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!. Using Media Player to sync did no better. Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop. A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on. After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit. The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job. This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons. Throughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it. I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well. As it stands, it's without merit as a player."}

You're given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical), which is all you really need. Movies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind, in front, and to your left and right when you're connected via optical.

As a college guy, I couldn't bring my 1010 watt system from home. Which, I might add, never sounded as good as my headphones, mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically. Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things. You'd be amazed at Coldplay's \"The Scientist\" if you heard it on these headphones. It's indescribable. And by the way, I'm a slight audiophile. You seriously can't go wrong with these headphones.

{"id": "electronics-positive-84", "domain": "electronics", "label": 1, "text": "For those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful. Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc. It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one. One of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section. I record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station's tape deck to my iRiver. For those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it's a little trickier. You have to set the record input before -- you can't change it on the fly. I've recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on. Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show. Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show. I've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results. A bit of trial and error which I'm still refining with later iRiver products. The single AA batter lasts a good long time. Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low. If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved! The negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive. Files are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer. I don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file. But you can't trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don't think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another. Also, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way. I've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes. I'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button. After so many presses, it's starting to wear out. But it's still working reliably. I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention. I have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great. I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it. Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.

Only downside: The D-pad is hard to control precisely. It's difficult to press only Up, Down, Left or Right. You almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead.

{"id": "electronics-negative-328", "domain": "electronics", "label": 0, "text": "I purchased this for my Intel iMac mainly because I was so frustrated with the Mighty Mouse. I wanted something with two separate buttons. I had tried the Logitech MX 610 (which I purchased as well for another computer) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful. So, I purchased this desktop set because I wanted it to match my Mac and so I could have a proper 2 button mouse. I figured the Mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well. In fact, I thought I would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a Mac and had extra shortcut buttons. Other than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse, this keyboard/mouse combo has been an utter disappointment. First of all, the white doesn't quite match. It's close, but just a touch too cream. Also, there's just too much silver. Especially on the mouse. Secondly, it doesn't have all the buttons the Mighty Mouse does. There is no button to switch to the Widgets. Luckily, you can press F12 on the keyboard. Not quite as convenient, but still possible. However, I have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs. This is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open. Thirdly, this mouse just doesn't work as well as other Logitechs. It is too light, lacking the \"feel\" and a bit of the comforting weight that the MX 610 has when you move it around. Also, the speed of the cursor is off. No matter how I try to adjust the speed, it doesn't quite match the speed of the original Mighty Mouse. It is either too fast or too slow. I think part of it is simply OSX's lack of adjustability compared to [gasp] Windows for cursor speed. Finally, the keyboard is simply atrocious. I don't even use it anymore. It's packed up in the box and I plugged the original Mac keyboard back in. The keys make a horrendous clatter when typing. The pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal. Also, the depth is quite shallow. This is a desktop keyboard. You can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards I've tried. Also, the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform. The raised dots to help you find the F or J buttons is too shallow. I can't find the asdf an jkl; rows by touch. I have to look. As a touch typist, this is an unforgiveable sin. It basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it. I'm typing on a Thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this Logitech. So, in short, save your money and avoid this keyboard/mouse combo. I rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons, unlike the Mighty Mouse, which is why I purchased this in the first place. It hit my most basic requirement. Otherwise, it really deserves a 1 star rating"}

In one case, the disc had a blank band between two burned ones! The Memorex discs I'm referring to have Manufacturer ID \"CMC MAG, AM3\". According to videohelp.com, these are sold under at least 7 different brand names. The reviews there are rather mixed, which is not IMHO good enough!

I live in Los Angeles. I got this little Roady XT for me, and the XM2GO radio receiver for my wife. I was excited about getting these new satellite receivers in our cars. The Idea of having all these \"no ads\" radio stations playing through my car's FM frequency seemed cool. Setting up the unit and getting it to work was easy. Changing FM frequencies for the wireless transmitter is easy as well. It really is a neat little receiver. However, after setting up this unit in my car and the XM2GO in my wife's car, I was really disappointed in the music sound quality. The music sounds flat and with a hissy quality, almost monaural at times, and the volume seems a lot lower than the car's radio at the same volume setting. I had to turn the volume dial up quite a bit when playing satellite radio. The car's regular radio sounds much better than satellite radio if using wireless reception with any of the radio receivers, IMO. Besides, there are plenty of annoying ads and interruptions on XM radio as someone mentioned in another review. I thought about having the units professionally installed so that my wife and I wouldn't have to use the poor sounding wireless FM technology, but realized that both family cars have very expensive navigation systems and I didn't want the vehicle's factory warranty voided if some installer got inside our car's dash and accidentally messed something up. So about two month's ago, after several months of off-and-on use of XM radio service, I called to cancel my subscriptions. I had paid for a six month subscription for both receivers when I joined. As I expected would happen, when I called them to cancel, I was on the phone for allloooooonnnng time waiting for a customer service rep. Finally, I got to tell the rep all my relevant account information so I could cancel the service only to be put on hold and transferred to their \"special\" customer service department for cancellations where I was \"accidentally\" disconnected and had to call back and start all over again. Finally, after another long call to them, I was able to cancel my service.....or, so I thought. Yesterday, I was looking at my September credit card bill and saw that XM radio had charged my credit card for the next six months despite the fact that they assured me that my two accounts would be closed. I called my bank and had them reverse the charges and I may have the bank issue me a new credit card with different numbers in case XM tries to charge me again six months from now."}

Earbuds and over ear headphones don't block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music. I received these Philips HN110 headphones as a gift. When I first got these I was pretty disappointed at how flimsy they appeared. I have some KOSS over ear head phones which are nice and beefy. These are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space. They use a single AAA batt. Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through. I'm not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies. Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through. The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off. My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there (or it runs through the headphone band). I realize I like this single cord feature very much. Again these Philips HN 110 don't have this. I also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified. After about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside. Now I can't open the battery compartment without doing some damage to these headphones. I checked Philips website for info on these phones but I couldn't find any. I called their customer support and they told me I had to call a different #. I called the different number and got the Return Merchandise Authorization # but was told I need to send the receipt in. I got them as a gift so I don't have the receipt. In summary, their noise cancelling ability is pretty week. Better than my hefty non-noise cancelling KOSS over ears or my stethascope like Sony ear buds but only by about 10% or so (just to put a number in their). Flimsy design. Cords from both earphones.

But here are my 2 cents: I got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago. The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years. I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better. They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them). The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound. I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that). I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass. They appear to have the right amount. (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound). I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).

Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent. I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed. Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before! It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs. The controls are also simple to use, both on the cord and on the PC. Audio recording quality is great as well. I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it. Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side, however. Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock. My biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department. I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones. Usually, I wear high-quality buds. So, perhaps I just have to get used to it. However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones. Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes. So, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165. They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort? Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me. UPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference. The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s. Also, the comfort is much better. They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.

I called Netgear, waited on hold for 15 minutes, and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good. I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it. He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server. I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server (perhaps there are some), but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration. I went around and around with this fellow, then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold, another guy came on the line, who was pretty fluent in English. He explained his understanding of the situation, which was still wrong, and I explained the whole thing again to him. He had me turn the computer on and off, which of course I had already done several times, and check the monitor connection. After this analysis, he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it, and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly, that, coincidently, occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation, and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would, and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY, (emphasis his) that his software could have caused these symptoms. Since I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone, I suggested that I could take it to a local technician, and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system.

He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere). When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true. One speaker instead of five? Wall-mounted? Doesn't take up any floor space? We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves. One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment. The other, on the salesroom floor. In both set-ups it performed consistantly. In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement. So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer. Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools. The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television. Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer. My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound. More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning. Overall, we both got what we wanted.

But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints. But I tried a local test first. I used roads as waypoints, main roads. This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes. I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database. I set up a local route, and started to follow it. It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem. But it would not go past the first waypoint. I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!. I did. Then it said take another u turn. It had me going in circles. Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would. The manual was no help. Support was no help. So it went back. I have ordered a Garmin i2. Hope this is ok. I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330. The Garmin has maps that you cannot update, but got me to my destination no problem. I don't recommend this TomTom. Do research. Go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals.

I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips! I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!"}

{"id": "electronics-positive-645", "domain": "electronics", "label": 1, "text": "I hadn't seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod). The holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It's very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me. The part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version, so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups. The only \"bad\" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok. I like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you're willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway. Edit: I bought it for $20, but now it's $15. One more good reason to get this one. I'm not too sure, but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do, I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this, so don't buy this for your 5G iPod unless you're already sure or can try it before you buy it"}

However, I felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of \"X\" color installed. It happens now between every print job, forcing me to open the printer, pull out and re-install one to three of the tanks, and then print my document. There is something wrong with this thing, and I don't appear to be the first experiencing it. Figures... I wait eight years to replace my printer, and end up with one that malfunctions! I will attempt to return this item"}
{"id": "electronics-negative-489", "domain": "electronics", "label": 0, "text": "Run WinXP, sp2 with everything updated. I've had this router for 6 months. It is the WGT624v3, firmware updated. I never realized how bad the wireless was on this router until this week - dropped connetion 3 times in 15 minutes today alone, while reading the Amazon.com reviews. My desktop PC's graphics card went down this past week and I had to RMA it... so about 10 days to send out and get a return. I have always used a wired connection for my home desktops. The wireless access was a 'it's there if I need it' novelty. I started brining my IBM R51 laptop home from work so I could get online, VPN into work, etc.. This is the first time I have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so. The last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least. I logged on my first day and lost connection 5-6 times browsing MSN and Yahoo. At first I thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11. I went ahead and disabled the 108G feature since I had never come close to hitting that speed anyways, and changed the channel.. I used the IBM ThinkVantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used. I changed channels and I verified my signal strength before and after I changed, 95% signal strength. The connection is still getting dropped randomly. Changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength. No difference. Scanned the networks again using the IBM ThinkVantage software.. theres my router, 97% signal strength @ 54Mbs. unplugged router, modem, repaired my WINSOCKS with WinsockXP, rebooted PC. I turned on my modem first until is was ready to go, then the router until it was ready, and then my PC (as per the netgear website)and yea, no difference in the connections stability. The conection is still getting dropped randomly. I might expect this from a router thats on all the time and is getting tired from constantly being hammered. But I hardly ever used the wireless access (yes, wireless radio has been OFF). After reading these reviews, I am pretty sure the problem wont go away. The part that upsets me the most, I payed premium money for a product that I thought was premium. If this had been priced (at the time) at bargain bin prices, I wouldn't of cared.. but it wasn't and i do. The 'you get what you pay for' saying does not hold true for this product. Buyer Beware"}

Both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that. I was so mad I almost threw it against the wall. I thought the first one was a defect, but then when I got the second one I realized it was a design flaw... If you buy the Targus one keep your receipt because I guarantee you will be returning it. What I don't get is how Targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it: Satisfaction Guaranteed. What a joke.."}

I wish someone had posted before the Dec. 22 posting (which was excellent) pointing out that this device doesn't work on an iPod \"shuffle\". I spent more to ship this item than I did for the item itself, so I am also stuck with one. Rats!!"}
{"id": "electronics-positive-203", "domain": "electronics", "label": 1, "text": "I recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift. Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews. It's great. The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply. The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own. Many people comment on the bass issue. For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion. True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website). I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience. The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit. Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not. There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also). By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew. Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto."}

{"id": "electronics-positive-560", "domain": "electronics", "label": 1, "text": "I did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse. I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable. At home, I use a Wacom tablet. Next month I am traveling abroad, so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington. Wireless was key for portability. I also wanted something rechargeable, and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out. I received it today, and I'm on my first charge. So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway). - I have large but skinny hands. Mouse is small, but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers. Of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse, but if you want portability, this is about the right size. - I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4). Excellent Bluetooth connection. Also very good response, very little delay. Only reservation is for the scroll wheel, which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands, because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position. It is hard to explain, but not a big issue for me. - USB charger works well. The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat, but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse) - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse. - As mentioned by others, installing the batteries is a challenge. Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers. Once I figured it out, not so hard. Overall, I don't seek perfection anyway, so this mouse does the job adequately for me. I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before, so I'm more or less in awe"}

Everytime you need to change the volume or track you have to pull your ipod out. My ipod had scratch marks on it the first week. Unfortunately, all the picture you see of this case is from the side view, so you cannot see that there is no opening for the wheel and the display. I recommend iskin product."}
